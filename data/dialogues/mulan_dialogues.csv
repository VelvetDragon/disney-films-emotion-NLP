Mulan,Guard ,We're under attack!  Light the signal! [Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long Hair Man appear trying to stop him.  Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with his sword just as Guard reaches the top.  The guard picks up the torch to light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the tower and looks at him across from the caldron.  The guard throws the torch into the caldron lighting a large fire.  Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons one by one]
Mulan,Guard ,Now all of China knows you're here.
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,"Perfect. [Cut to the palace.  The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li walks in flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. He bows, then looks up]"
Mulan,General Li,"Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border."
Mulan,Chi Fu,Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall.  [The Emperor motions for Chi Fu's silence]
Mulan,General Li,Shun-Yu is leading them.  We'll set up defenses around your palace immediately.
Mulan,Emperor ,"No!  Send your troops to protect my people.  Chi Fu,"
Mulan,Chi Fu,"Yes, your highness."
Mulan,Emperor,Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.  Call up reserves and as many new recruits as possible.
Mulan,General Li,"Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him."
Mulan,Emperor,"I wont take any chances, General.  A single grain of rice can tip the scale.  One man may be the difference between victory and defeat. [Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the mound of rice]"
Mulan,Mulan,"Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...[picking up some rice with her chopsticks and eating a mouthful] delicate...refined...poised... [She sets down her chopsticks and writes down a final word on her right arm] punctual. Aiya.    Little brother. Little brother.  Lit- ahhh, there you are.  Who's the smartest doggie in the world?  Come on smart boy, can you help me with my chores today? [Mulan ties a sack of grain around Little Brother's waist.  She ties a stick onto Little brother so that end of it is in front of Little Brother's face. She ties the bone on the end of the stick just out of reach.  Little Brother begins to run after the bone which he cannot reach.  Mulan opens the door for Little Brother and he runs into the door frame, then out the open door. Little brother runs by the chickens and Khan - the family horse] [Cut to Mulan's Father, Fa Zhou, kneeling and praying before the Fa family's ancestors]"
Mulan,Fa Zhou,"Honorable ancestors, please help Mulan impress the matchmaker today. Little Brother [running into the temple and around Fa Zhou scattering grain around the floor]: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark. [The chickens follow Little Brother into the temple and begin to feed on the grain]"
Mulan,Fa Zhou,"Please, PLEASE, help her. [Mulan steps up to the temple seeing Little Brother on his hind legs trying to get the bone.  Mulan bends the stick down so that Little brother can reach the bone.  Little brother gnaws on the bone happily.  Mulan continues toward the temple]"
Mulan,Mulan ,Father I brought your--whoop!  [Fa Zhou bumps into Mulan. The cup falls to the ground and Fa Zhou catches the teapot with the handle of his cane]
Mulan,Fa Zhou,Mulan--
Mulan,Mulan,I brought a spare. [Mulan pulls out a cup from underneath the back of her dress and begins to pour the tea]
Mulan,Fa Zhou,Mulan--
Mulan,Mulan ,"Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning--"
Mulan,Fa Zhou,Mulan--
Mulan,Mulan,And three at night.
Mulan,Fa Zhou,"Mulan, you should already be in town.  We're counting on you to up--"
Mulan,Mulan,--uphold the family honor.  Don't worry father.  I wont let you down. Wish me luck.
Mulan,Fa Zhou ,Hurry!   I'm going to...pray some more.
Mulan,Bath Lady ,"Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? The matchmaker is not a patient woman."
Mulan,Fa Li,Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for luck.
Mulan,Grandma Fa ,"How lucky can they be, they're dead.  Besides,  I've got all the luck we'll need.  [Speaking to Cri-Kee]  This is your chance to prove yourself.  [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street]"
Mulan,Fa Li ,"Grandma No! [The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two horse and carriage collide causing a big accident.  She arrives at the other side of the street, uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee]"
Mulan,Grandma Fa,"Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of fright]"
Mulan,Fa Li ,Hai. [Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and jumps off with hay stuck in her hair]
Mulan,Mulan,I'm here.   What?  But Mama I had to--
Mulan,Fa Li,None of your 'xcuses.  Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk together into the preparation area]
Mulan,Bath Lady,"[all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the Bath] This is what you give me to work with? Well, honey, I've seen worse. We're gonna turn this sow's ear Into a silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in the bath]"
Mulan,Mulan ,It's freezing.
Mulan,Fa Li ,It would have been warm if you were here on time.
Mulan,Mulan ,"Ahh, notes, in case I forget something?"
Mulan,Grandma Fa ,"Here, hold this .  We'll need more luck than I thought."
Mulan,Fa Li and others,[Mulan following her Mother passes a xiangqi game and pauses to make an impressive move.  Mulan has a smug look on her face when Fa Li comes back and drags Mulan away] A girl can bring her family Great honor in one way By striking a good match And this could be the day
Mulan,Mulan ,huh.
Mulan,Chorus,"[Mulan follows Fa Li and sees boy stealing a doll from a girl.  Mulan grabs the doll from the boy and returns it to its owner] We all must serve our Emperor Who guards us from the Huns A man by bearing arms A girl by bearing sons Make-up Lady/Fa Li: When we're through you can't fail Like a lotus blossom soft and pale How could any fellow say ""No sale"" You'll bring honor to us all [Make-Up Lady holds a mirror so Mulan can see her reflection.  Not looking pleased, Mulan takes her single, short bang and brings it down in front of her forehead and smiles]"
Mulan,Fa Li ,"There, you're ready."
Mulan,Grandma Fa ,Not yet! An apple for serenity [putting an apple in Mulan's mouth]...A pendant for balance [places a yin-yang pendant under her sash] Beads of jade for beauty You must proudly show it Now add a cricket just for luck [putting the cage with Cri-Kee under Mulan's sash in the back.  Cri-Kee doesn't look pleased] And even you can't blow it

Mulan,Matchmaker,Speaking without permission.
Mulan,Mulan,Oops.
Mulan,Grandma Fa ,Who spit in her bean curd? [Mulan walks into the Matchmaker's building with the Matchmaker following behind and closing the door]
Mulan,Matchmaker ,"Huh, Hmm, too skinny.  [Cri-Kee escapes from his cage.  Mulan struggles to catch him] Hmph, not good for bearing sons. Recite the final admonition."
Mulan,Mulan ,Mmm-Hmm.  [Takes out fan and covers her mouth as she spits out Cri-Kee] Ptu
Mulan,Matchmaker,Well...
Mulan,Mulan ,"Fulfill your duties calmly and re...f--[looking at her arm with smeared writing] spectfully.  Reflect before you snack [surprised, Mulan looks at her arm again] act.   This shall bring you honor and glory.   Huh. Matchmaker [snatches the fan and looks at it on both sides looking for notes not finding any.  Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her.  Matchmaker grabs Mulan's right arm pulling her along while smearing the writing and leaving some ink on her hand]  Hmmm, this way.  Now, pour the tea  [Pushing a teapot towards Mulan].  To please your future in-laws you must demonstrate a sense of dignity [Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth.  Mulan staring at Matchmaker pours some tea onto the table then notices her mistake and pours the tea into the cup] and refinement.  You must also be poised.  [Mulan notices Cri-kee in the tea-cup as Matchmaker takes the cup]"
Mulan,Mulan ,"Um, pardon me."
Mulan,Matchmaker,And silent!
Mulan,Mulan ,Could I just take that back...one moment. [They struggle for the teacup and it turns over on Matchmaker and Cri-kee jumps down matchmaker's dress]
Mulan,Matchmaker,"Why you clumsy--[Matchmaker feels Cri-Kee in her dress and dances around]  Wooo, woooo, wooooooo, [Matchmaker knocks over her pot of coals, and sits down on the coals.  Matchmaker jumps around screaming]  Ahhhhhhhhhhh [Mulan grabs her fan and briskly fans the charred area on Matchmaker's behind causing it to flame up.  Mulan looks surprised about her mistake] [Cut to outside Matchmakers building showing Grandma Fa with much noise coming from Matchmaker's building]"
Mulan,Grandma Fa ,"I think it's going well, don't you?"
Mulan,Matchmaker ,"Put it out! Put it out! Put it out! [Mulan takes the teapot, throws the tea on Matchmaker and puts out the fire.  She bows, hands the teapot back to Matchmaker and covers her face as she walks toward Fa Li and Grandma Fa]   You are a disgrace! You may look like a bride, but you will never bring your family honor! [Cut to Mulan walking through the gate with her home leading khan.  She looks sorrowful.  Fa Zhou sees his daughter and smiles.  Mulan sees her father's smile.  She covers her face with Khan's head and leads him to the water trough]"
Mulan,Fa Zhou,"My, my, what beautiful blossoms we have this year [looking up into the blossom tree].  But look, this one's late.  But, I'll bet that when it blooms, it will be the most beautiful of all.  [Mulan and Fa Zhou share smiles.  Drums start pounding announcing the arrival of Chi Fu and two guards on horseback]"
Mulan,Mulan,What is it? [Fa Zhou gets up and walks to the entrance of their house with Mulan following]
Mulan,Fa Li,"Mulan, stay inside. [Grandma Fa clears her throat catching Mulan's attention and motions inside. Mulan spies the railing near the wall and climbs up to watch over the roof]"
Mulan,Chi Fu,Citizens  I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City:  the Huns have invaded China!
Mulan,Townspeople ,No!
Mulan,Chi Fu,"By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the Imperial Army.  The Xiao family [a family member steps up, bows to the guard and takes the conscription notice from the guard].  The Yi family. Yi's Son :  I will serve the Emperor in my father's place."
Mulan,Chi Fu,The Fa Family.
Mulan,Mulan,No. [Fa Zhou gives his cane to Fa Li and walks toward Chi Fu.  Fa Zhou bows before the horsemen]
Mulan,Fa Zhou ,"I am ready to serve the Emperor.  [Fa Zhou reaches for the conscription notice] Mulan [running outside to keep her father from taking the conscription notice]:  Father, you can't go."
Mulan,Fa Zhou ,Mulan!
Mulan,Mulan,"Please sir, my father has already fought bravely--"
Mulan,Chi Fu,Silence!  You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue in a man's presence.
Mulan,Fa Zhou ,"Mulan, you dishonor me."
Mulan,Chi Fu ,Report tomorrow at the Wu Shu camp.
Mulan,Fa Zhou,"Yes, sir. [Fa Zhou walks back into the homestead refusing to take his cane from Fa Li]"
Mulan,Chi Fu ,"The Chu family.  The Wen family. The Chang family.  The... [Cut to Fa Zhou in his armory at night.  Fa Zhou takes out his sword and practices his stances.  Whan he balances on his right leg, his leg injury acts up and he falls.  Unbeknownst to her father, Mulan watches in horror.  She breathes heavily] [Cut to dinner.  The Fa Zhou, Grandma Fa, Fa Li, and Mulan eat in silence. Thunder can be heard and lightning can be seen through the opaque window. Mulan pours the tea for her family.  She slams her teacup down on the table and stands up]"
Mulan,Mulan,You shouldn't have to go.
Mulan,Fa Li,Mulan!
Mulan,Mulan,There are plenty of young men to fight for China.
Mulan,Fa Zhou,It is an honor to protect my country and my family.
Mulan,Mulan ,So you'll die for honor!
Mulan,Fa Zhou ,I will DIE doing what's right.
Mulan,Mulan ,But if you--
Mulan,Fa Zhou,"I know my place, it is time you learned yours. [Mulan looking like she's about to cry, turn away from Fa Zhou and runs outside into the rain storm and cries] [Cut to Mulan sitting at the base of the Great Stone Dragon in the rain. Mulan looks down to see her reflection in the puddle caused by the rain. She watches her parents in the bedroom.  Fa Li turns away from Fa Zhou and walks out of site.  Fa Zhou blows out the light.  Mulan gets up and walks to the Fa Family Temple.  Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she lights incense and places it in the hanging encense holder.  She bows and prays to her ancestors. Getting up, Mulan hurries down the steps.  Cri-Kee sees her and hops down from above and follows her.  Mulan goes to her parent's bedroom and takes the conscription notice replacing it with the hair comb her mother gave to her.  She pauses to give her parents a loving, sorrowful look and hurries out.  Cut to Mulan in the armory.  She opens the cabinet with the armor. Using her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and ties it up above her head.  She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the front.  She takes the sword and places it in the scabbard to her left.  Cut to Mulan in the stable doorway.  Khan rears back in fright at the sight of Mulan.  Mulan goes forward and comforts Khan letting him know her identity.  Mulan walks Khan out of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground as she passes by.  Mulan takes one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan through the gate and off to camp.] [Cut to the face of a statue in the Fa Family Temple.  The eyes glow.  Cut to Grandma Fa.  She wakes up with a start rising in bed.  Cut to Grandma Fa walking into Fa Li and Fa Zhou's bedroom, both are in bed]"
Mulan,Grandma Fa,Mulan is gone.
Mulan,Fa Zhou ,What?  It can't be.  [Fa Zhou looks at his night stand and notices the hair comb in place of his conscription notice.  He checks the cabinet and sees his armor is gone.  He hurries outside]   Mulan! No.
Mulan,Fa Li ,You must go after her.  She could be killed!
Mulan,Fa Zhou ,"If I reveal her, she will be."
Mulan,Grandma Fa,"Ancestors, hear our prayer: Watch over Mulan. [Cut to the Fa Family Temple.  A wind blows out the incense at the base of the center stone.  The center stone begins to glow as First Ancestor comes to life]"
Mulan,First Ancestor ,"Mushu, awaken! [Mushu comes to life and falls to the ground flat on his back all being obscured by smoke]"
Mulan,Mushu ,I live!  So tell me what mortal needs my protection Great Ancestor.  You just say the word and I'm there.
Mulan,First Ancestor ,Mushu!
Mulan,Mushu,"Hey, let me say something. Anybody who is foolish enough to threaten our family, vengeance will be MINE.  Hrrrrr."
Mulan,First Ancestor ,Mushu!  These are the family guardians . They...
Mulan,Mushu ,Protect the family.
Mulan,First Ancestor ,"And you, oh demoted one."
Mulan,Mushu,I...ring the gong.
Mulan,First Ancestor,"That's right, now, wake up the ancestors."
Mulan,Mushu,"One family reunion coming right up.   Okay people, people look alive, lets go! C'mon get up.  Let's move it, rise and shine. You're way past the beauty sleep thing now trust me!"
Mulan,Ancestor 1,"I knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a trouble maker from the start."
Mulan,Ancestor 3,"Don't look at me, she gets it from your side of the family."
Mulan,Ancestor 2,She's just trying to help her father.
Mulan,Ancestor 4 ,"But, if she is discovered, Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.  Dishonor will come to the family.  Traditional values will disintegrate."
Mulan,Ancestor 5,Not to mention they'll lose the farm.
Mulan,Ancestor 1,My children never caused such trouble.  They all became acupuncturists.
Mulan,Ancestor 3,"Well, We can't all be acupuncturists."
Mulan,Ancestor 6,"No, your great granddaughter had to be cross-dresser!"
Mulan,Ancestor 7,Let a guardian bring her back.
Mulan,Ancestor 8 ,"Yeah, awaken the most cunning."
Mulan,First Ancestor,Silence!  We must send the most powerful of all [Motioning to the Great Stone Dragon as it is seen through the window]
Mulan,Mushu ,"Ho, ho, heh, heh. Okay, okay, I get the drift, I'll go. [All Ancestors give a quick look of surprise and laugh uncontrollably]  You all don't think I can do it.  Watch this here. Ah, ha, Jump back, I'm pretty hot huh.  Don't make me have to singe nobody to prove no point."
Mulan,First Ancestor ,You had your chance to protect the Fa family.
Mulan,Ancestor 6,Your mis-guidance led Fa Deng to disaster.
Mulan,Fa Deng ,"Yeah, thanks a lot."
Mulan,Mushu,And your point is?
Mulan,First Ancestor,The point is we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.
Mulan,Mushu,"What?  But I'm a real dragon. First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling him away from the guardian post as Mushu fights to hold on]:  You are not worthy of this spot.  Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon."
Mulan,Mushu ,So you'll get back to me on the job thing.
Mulan,Mushu ,"Just one chance is that too much to ask?  I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya."
Mulan,Mushu ,"Yo rocky, wake up!  You gotta go fetch Mulan.  [pauses as nothing happens.  Mushu walks over to the side of the statue] C'mon boy, go get her, go on, [throws the gong stick off the screen and whistles] Come on.  [Angrily while climbing up the Great Stone Dragon] Grrr, Grrrr.  [speaking in his ear and banging the ear with the gong] Hello, helloooooo.  Hello [bangs the gong extra hard against the ear causing it to break off].  Uh oh.  [The Great Stone Dragon crumbles to the ground, head intact minus the ear].  [knocks on the dragon's head] Uh, Stoney, Stooooneeey.  Oh man, they're gonna kill me!"
Mulan,First Ancestor ,"Great Stone Dragon, have you awaken? Mushu [holding the head of the Great Stone Dragon up to that First Ancestor can only see it's head and Mushu's body]:  Uhhh, Yes, I just woke up.  And I am the Great Stone Dragon, good morning .  I will go forth and fetch Mulan.  Did, did I mention that I was the Great Stone Dragon?"
Mulan,First Ancestor,"Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws."
Mulan,Mushu,"Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face.  [Mushu falls down the hill under the weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the dragon's pedestal with the head falling on top of him]"
Mulan,Mushu ,"Ow, my elbow.  Aw, aw, I know I twisted something. That's just great.  Now what?  I'm doomed!   And all 'cause miss man decides to take her little drag show on the road."
Mulan,Cri-Kee,"Chirp, Chirp."
Mulan,Mushu,"Go get her?   What's the matter with you?  After this great stone Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the temple.  Wait a minute, that's it!  I make Mulan a war hero, then they'll be begging me to come back to work.  That's the master plan.  Oh, you've gone and done it now."
Mulan,Cri-Kee ,Chirp.  Chirp Chirp Chirp.
Mulan,Mushu ,"Hey, what makes you think you're coming?"
Mulan,Cri-Kee,"Chirp, Chirp."
Mulan,Mushu,"You're lucky?  Ho, ho, heh.  Do I look like a sucker to you?"
Mulan,Cri-Kee,Chirp. Chirp.
Mulan,Mushu,"Whach' you mean loser?  How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off and throw it across the yard.  Then who's a loser, me or you? [Cut to Shan-Yu leading his army at a charge on horseback through a forest. He stops and motions stage right.  Hun Archer, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Long-Hair Guy dismount and walk into the forest.  They throw down two Imperial scouts before the rest of the army]"
Mulan,Hun Long-Hair Guy,Imperial scouts.
Mulan,Scout #1,Shan-Yu.
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,"Nice work, gentlemen.  You found the Hun army."
Mulan,Scout #2,The Emperor will stop you.
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,How many men does it take to deliver a message.
Mulan,Archer Guy ,One.
Mulan,Mulan,"Okay, okay, how 'bout this?  Ahem,  excuse me, where do I sign in?  Hah, I see you have a sword.  I have one too.  They're very manly and tough [Mulan bites her lip as she mishandles pulling the sword out of the scabbard and it falls to the ground.  Khan rolls on his back in laughter.  Mulan throws her shoe and hits Khan in the head with it quieting Khan].  I'm working on it.  Who am I fooling?  It's going to take a miracle to get me into the army. [Mushu appears as a giant shadow being cast on a rock with flames on either side.  Mushu's real appearance remains out of sight]"
Mulan,Mushu ,Did I hear someone ask for a miracle!?  Let me hear you say aye!
Mulan,Mulan ,Ahhhhhh.
Mulan,Mushu,That's close enough.
Mulan,Mulan ,Ghost.
Mulan,Mushu,"Get ready Mulan your serpentine salvation is at hand.

[Mulan smiles big in anticipation of seeing her guardian] I am the powerful, the pleasurable, the indestructible [coming out from the rocks to show his real size] Mushu! Oh hah, hah, pretty hot, huh? [Khan stomps on Mushu.  Mulan pushes Khan back]"
Mulan,Mulan,"Ah, my ancestors sent a little lizard to help me?"
Mulan,Mushu,"Hey, dragon, dragon,  not lizard.  I don't do that tongue thing [flips out his tongue to show Mulan what he means]."
Mulan,Mulan,You're uh...
Mulan,Mushu,Intimidating?  Awe inspiring?
Mulan,Mulan ,Tiny.
Mulan,Mushu ,"Of course.  I'm travel size for your convenience.  If I was my real size, your cow here would die of fright.    [pointing to the ground speaking to Khan] Down Bessy.  My powers are beyond your mortal imagination. For instance,  my eyes can see straight through your armor.  [Mulan cover her bust with her left arm and slaps Mushu with the right]  Ow.

Mulan walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose and another man picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautiful isn't it?"
Mulan,Mulan ,They're disgusting.
Mulan,Mushu,"No, they're men.  And you're going to have to act just like them, so pay attention."
Mulan,Tattoo Soldier ,"Look, this tattoo will protect me from harm. [Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the stomach causing Ling to laugh.  Mulan watches in utter amazement.  Yao kisses his hand]"
Mulan,Ling ,I hope you can get your money back.
Mulan,Mulan,I don't think I can do this.
Mulan,Mushu,It's all attitude.  Be tough like this guy here .
Mulan,Yao ,What are you looking at?
Mulan,Mushu,"Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.' [Mulan looks at her fist, then punches Yao from behind on the shoulder.  The force causes Yao to run into Chien-Po]"
Mulan,Chien-Po,"Oh Yao, you made a friend."
Mulan,Mushu,"Good, Now slap him on the behind, they like that."
Mulan,Yao,Wu hoo hooooo.    I'm going to hit you so hard it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

Mulan,Mushu ,Chicken boy!?  Say that to my face ya limp noodle! [Yao grabs Mulan by the collar cocking back his arm to punch.  Mulan ducks as Yao hits Ling standing behind her]
Mulan,Yao,"Oh, sorry Ling.  Hey! [Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away.  Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jump attacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of Chien-Po]"
Mulan,Ling,"You're dead.   Oh, there he goes. [Mulan runs into a tent and stops.  Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po  run through the tent.  Yao stops short as he is about to run into a soldier in a line for food.  He looks behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time.  Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire line of soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it.  The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan who has emerged from the tent.  They angrily start walking towards her.  Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is about to brew]"
Mulan,Mulan,Hey guys.
Mulan,General Li ,"The Huns have struck here, here and here.  I will take the main troops up to the Tung Shao Pass and stop Shan-Yu before he destroys this village."
Mulan,Chi Fu,"Excellent strategy, Sir.  I do love surprises, Ha ha, ha, ha."

Mulan,Shang ,"Oh, I will.  I wont let you down.  This is, I mean, I... yes sir."
Mulan,General Li ,Very good then.  We'll toast China's victory at the Imperial City.   I'll expect a full report in three weeks.
Mulan,Chi Fu ,And I wont leave anything out.
Mulan,Shang ,"Captain Li Shang, Hmmm, leader of China's finest troops.  No, the greatest troops of all time. Heh, heh, heh, heh.  [Shang walks out of the tent to see the recruits fighting.  He stands stage left of Chi Fu and General Li.  Injured Recruit sees the General and salutes him as he falls to the ground.  General Li steps over Injured Recruit and mounts his horse]"
Mulan,Chi Fu,Most impressive.

Mulan,Shang ,I don't need anyone causing trouble in my camp!
Mulan,Mulan,"Sorry,  Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that.    You know how it is when you get those, uh  manly urges and you just have to kill something , fix things, uh, cook outdoors."
Mulan,Shang,What's your name?
Mulan,Mulan ,"Ahh, I, uhhh, I, uh--"
Mulan,Chi Fu ,Your commanding officer just asked you a question.
Mulan,Mulan,"Uhh, I've got a name.  Huh.  And it's a boys name too."
Mulan,Mushu ,"Ling, How 'bout Ling?"
Mulan,Mulan ,His name's Ling.
Mulan,Shang,I didn't ask for his name.  I asked for yours.

Mulan,Shang,Ping.
Mulan,Mushu,Of course Ping DID steal my gir-
Mulan,Mulan,"Yes, my name is Ping."
Mulan,Shang,"Let me see your conscription notice.    Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou?"
Mulan,Chi Fu,I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.
Mulan,Mulan,"Um, he...doesn't talk about me much.  [Mulan tries to hawk up a loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth.  The recruits laugh]"
Mulan,Chi Fu,"I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic."
Mulan,Shang ,"Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice.  And tomorrow, the real work begins."
Mulan,Mushu ,"You know, we have to work on your people skills."
Mulan,Mushu,"All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty.   C'mon  hup, hup, hup.   Get your clothes on. Get ready.  Got breakfast for ya.    Look, you get porridge, and it's happy to see you.   Hey, get outta there, you gonna make people sick!"
Mulan,Mulan,Am I late?
Mulan,Mushu ,"No time to talk.  Now remember, it's your first day of training so listen to your teacher and no fighting.  Play nice with the other kids, unless of course one of the other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid's butt."
Mulan,Mulan ,But I don't wanna kick the other kid's butt.
Mulan,Mushu,"Don't talk with your mouth full.  Now let's see your war face . I think my bunny slippers just ran for cover.  C'mon scare me, girl!"
Mulan,Mulan ,Rrrrrrr!
Mulan,Mushu ,"Oh, that's my tough looking warrior.  That's what I'm talking about.  Now get out there and make me proud."
Mulan,Mushu,What do you mean the troops just left?
Mulan,Mulan ,They what!?
Mulan,Mushu ,"Wait, you forgot your sword.  My little baby off to destroy people ."
Mulan,Chi Fu ,"Order people, order!"
Mulan,Recruit #2,I'd like a pan fried noodle.
Mulan,Chien-Po,"Oh, oh, sweet and pungent shrimp"
Mulan,Recruit #3,Moo goo gai pan
Mulan,Chi Fu,That's not funny.
Mulan,Ling ,"Looks like our new friend slept in this morning.    Hellooo Ping, Are you hungry?"
Mulan,Yao,"Yeah, 'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich.  [grabs Mulan by the shirt collar drawing back his other arm.  Mulan hides her face with her hands.  Ling looks away, closes his eyes, and puts his fingers in his ears so that he wont hear anything]"
Mulan,All Soldiers ,Yeah.
Mulan,Shang ,Soldiers!  [The soldiers line up quicky.  Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows.  Mulan is duly impressed by Shang's physique] You will assemble swiftly and silently every morning.  Anyone who acts otherwise will answer to me.
Mulan,Yao,"Ooooo, tough guy."
Mulan,Shang ,Yao.  [All recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward.  Shang Points arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high pole]  Thank you for volunteering.  Retrieve the arrow.
Mulan,Yao ,I'll get that arrow pretty boy.  And I'll do it with my shirt on.
Mulan,Shang,"One moment, you seem to be missing something.  [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it high speaking to all the troops]  This represents discipline  [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao's arm with it]  and this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while Mulan looks concerned].  You need both to reach the arrow. [Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight.  Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take their turn and fall down.  Mulan rubs her behind as she walks away in front of Shang]"
Mulan,Shang,We've got a long way to go.
Mulan,Recruits ,Hua
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,What do you see?
Mulan,Hun Strong Man ,"Black pine, from the high mountains.  [Long Hair Hun Man takes the doll from Hun Strong Man.  Bald Hun Man #1 takes a hair as it passes by him]"
Mulan,Bald Hun Man #1,White horse hair.  Imperial stallions.
Mulan,Long Hair Hun Man ,"Sulfur, from cannons."
Mulan,Shan-Yu,"This doll came from a village in the Tung Shao Pass, where the Imperial Army's waiting for us."
Mulan,Hun Archer,We can avoid them easily.
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,"No, the quickest way to the Emperor is through that pass.  Besides, the little girl will be missing her doll.  We should return it to her."
Mulan,Mushu,"Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea.  What if somebody sees you?"
Mulan,Mulan ,Just because I look like a man doesn't mean I have to smell like one.
Mulan,Mushu ,"So a couple of guys don't rinse out their socks, picky, picky, picky.  Well myself I kinda like that corn chip's smell."
Mulan,Mulan ,Ahhhhhhh.
Mulan,Mushu,"Okay, all right, all right, that's enough.  Now, c'mon, get out before you get all pruny and stuff [holding out a towel towards Mulan keeping his eyes covered]."
Mulan,Mulan,"Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch."
Mulan,Mushu,"Yeah, yeah,  stand watch Mushu while I blow our secret with my stupid girly habits.  Humph, hygiene."
Mulan,Cri-Kee ,"Chirp, Chirp."
Mulan,Yao,Me first! Me first! Me First!
Mulan,Mushu ,Ah.  We're doomed!  There a couple of things I know they're bound to notice! [Yao and Ling jump into the water.  Chien-Po dips in his toe to check temperature then jumps in causing a large wave.  Yao and Ling ride the wave towards Mulan.  Mulan sees them and hides her face behind a lily pad]
Mulan,Yao ,"Hey, Ping."
Mulan,Mulan ,"Oh hi guys, I didn't know you were *here*. [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po share ""this boy is strange"" looks] I was just washing, so now I'm clean and I'm gonna go.  Bye, bye.  [Mulan hides behind a rock keeping her front facing the rock]"
Mulan,Ling ,"Come back here.  I know we were jerks to you before so lets start over.  [extending his hand to shake hands with Mulan]  Hi, I'm Ling!"
Mulan,Mulan ,"Heh, heh.  [Mulan turns and wades away from Ling and runs into Chien-Po]"
Mulan,Chien-Po ,And I'm Chien-Po.
Mulan,Mulan ,Hello Chien-Po.
Mulan,Yao,"And I am Yao, king of the rock.  And there's nothin' you girls can do about it."
Mulan,Ling ,"Oh, yeah?  Well, I think Ping  and I could take you."
Mulan,Mulan ,I really don't want to take him anywhere.
Mulan,Ling ,"Ping, we have to fight!"
Mulan,Mulan,No we don't.   We could just close our eyes and swim around.
Mulan,Ling,C'mon don't be such a g--Ouch!  Something bit me.
Mulan,Mushu ,What a nasty flavor.
Mulan,Ling ,Snake!
Mulan,Chien-Po ,"Snake, snake. [Mulan whistles for Khan and wades back to shore.  Khan comes close enough to shore and Mulan hides behind Khan as she wraps a towel around her body]"
Mulan,Ling,Some king of the rock!
Mulan,Mulan,"Boy, that was close."
Mulan,Mushu ,"No, that was vile!  You owe me big!"
Mulan,Mulan,I never want to see a naked man again.
Mulan,Mushu,"Hey, don't look at me.  I ain't biting any more butts."
Mulan,Chi Fu ,You think your troops are ready to fight?  Hah!  They would not last a minute against the Huns.
Mulan,Shang,They completed their training.
Mulan,Chi Fu,"Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain.  Once the general reads my report, your troops will never see battle."
Mulan,Mushu ,Oh no you don't.  I've worked to hard to get Mulan into this war.  This guy's messing with my plan.
Mulan,Shang ,We're not finished.
Mulan,Chi Fu ,"Be careful, Captain.  The General may be your father, but I am the Emperor's council.  And, oh, by the way, huh, I got that job on my own.   You're dismissed."
Mulan,Mulan ,"Hey, I'll hold him and you punch, heh, heh...   or not. For what it's worth, I think you're a great captain."
Mulan,Mushu ,I saw that!
Mulan,Mulan ,What?
Mulan,Mushu ,You like him don't you?
Mulan,Mulan,"No, I--"
Mulan,Mushu,"Yeah right, Yeah sure.  Look,   go to your tent.  [Mulan walks away with a look of delight. Mushu talks to Cri-Kee]  I think it's time we took this war into our own hands . [Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent.  Chi Fu emerges with carrying a scrub brush and wrapped in a towel and with big showering slippers on his feet.  He whistles as he walks off.  Mushu and Cri-Kee enter his tent.  Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter.  He finishes and Mushu takes the paper]"
Mulan,Mushu,"Okay, okay, let me see what you've got.  From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot if you'd come and back us up.    That's great except you forgot, ""and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't mind bringing up some.""  Hellooooo, this is the army!  Make it sound more urgent, please!  You know what I'm talkin' about?  [Cri-Kee starts writing the note again]  That's better, much better.   Okay, Let's go."
Mulan,Mushu,"Khan-ie baby, hey, we need a ride."
Mulan,Chi Fu ,"Insubordinate ruffians.    You men owe me a new pair of slippers.  And I do not squeal like a girl.   Aaaaaahhhhhh! Mushu [sitting on top of the panda bear behind a dummy of a soldier using sticks to gesticulate with the dummy's arms to push the note towards Chi Fu.  Cri-Kee works the mouth]:  Urgent news from the general!    What's the matter, you've never seen a 'black and white' before?"
Mulan,Chi Fu,Who are you?
Mulan,Mushu,"Excuse me!  I think the question is: who are you?  We're in a war man!  There's no time for stupid questions.  I should have your hat for that,  snatch it right off of your head [swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat.  Mushu turns the upper half of the dummy around after the panda passes Chi Fu.  Chi Fu begins reading the message].  But I'm feeling gracious today, so carry on before I report you."
Mulan,Chi Fu ,Captain.  Urgent news from the General.  We're needed at the front.
Mulan,Mushu ,"Pack your bags Cri-Kee, we're movin' out."
Mulan,Cow ,Moo
Mulan,Mulan ,Huh?
Mulan,Shang ,Search for survivors. [Cut to Mulan walking around the burned-out village.  She finds a the doll that Shan-Yu was holding and looks up sorrowfully.  Shang comes to her side]
Mulan,Shang,I don't understand.  My father should have been here.
Mulan,Chi Fu ,"Captain! [Chi Fu points down to the valley where the remains of General Li's army can be seen.  Flags poking up out of the snow, armor lying face down, broken cannon carts.  Ling, Yao, Mulan, and a soldier have the look of horror on their faces as they look into the valley.  Chien-Po walks up from the valley carrying a helmet]"
Mulan,Chien-po ,...the General. [Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill.  He draws his sword and stabs it into the snow upright.  He kneels down and places the helmet on top of the sword.  Mulan approaches him from behind]
Mulan,Mulan ,"I'm sorry. [Shang gets up, turns around and puts his hand on Mulan's shoulder and he walks by.  Shang walks to the center of the troops. He grabs his horse by the saddle, takes one quick look of grief then mounts his horse]"
Mulan,Shang,"The Huns are moving quickly.  We'll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass.  We're the only hope for the Emperor now.  Move out! [Mulan looks at the sword, takes out the doll she found and places the doll at the base of the sword.  She turns around and joins the rest of the troops marching on] [Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons.  A cannon blast shoots out of the cart and explodes in the air.  The troops look surprised.  Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face.  Mushu points at Cri-Kee.  Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind]"
Mulan,Shang ,What happened?!
Mulan,Mulan ,Uhhh--
Mulan,Shang,You just gave away our position.  Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the arrow]   Get out of range!! [The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them.  Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up.  Fire arrows start hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.  The cart begins to blaze with fire]
Mulan,Shang,"Save the cannons! [The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him from bolting.  Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.  The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan free from the cart.  She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire.  The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet and sword which land near her.  Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan."
Mulan,Mushu,"Oh sure, save the horse. [Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position.  Cri-Kee and Khan follow.  Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and other recruits set up cannons against rocks.  They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them]"
Mulan,Shang,Fire!
Mulan,Shang,"Fire! [Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  No more arrows can be seen coming from the mountain position]"
Mulan,Shang,"Hold the last cannon.    Prepare to fight.  If we die, we die with honor. [Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's position.  His falcon flies off his shoulder on Shan-Yu's war cry  The Hun army follows]"
Mulan,Shang,"Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu. [The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords.  Mulan looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snow embankment hanging to the side of a cliff.  She rushes forward]"
Mulan,Yao ,Hey.
Mulan,Shang,"Ping, come back.  Ping! [Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon.  Mushu looks over her at the oncoming horde with worry in his eyes]"
Mulan,Shang ,Stop!
Mulan,Mushu ,"All right, you might want to light that right about now.  Quickly!  Quickly!"
Mulan,Yao ,"C'mon, we've gotta help. [Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain.  She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him causing him to light the fuse.  Mushu lands on the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu]"
Mulan,Mushu ,You missed him!  How could you miss?  He was three feet in front of you! [The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche.  Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face and Shan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by the snow]
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,"Yrrrrrrraah. [Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side.  Mulan falls back grabbing her right side.  Shan-Yu's horse stumbles. Mulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche.  Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his horse.  Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him.   Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him, turning him around and helping him run away from the avalanche] Yao, Chien-Po and Ling :  Yeeahhhhhh!  [they stop.  noticing the oncoming avalanche they  turn around and run back to where they came from]  Waaaaaaaaaa! [Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up Shan-Yu and his horse.  Khan arrives at Mulan's position just ahead of the avalanche.  Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang.  She grabs his hand, then the avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing the oncoming avalanche of snow] [Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock.  They see the snow approaching close and run to larger shelter where the rest of Shang's army is positioned just as the avalance reaches their posision]"
Mulan,Mushu ,Mulan!  Mulan!   Mulan?
Mulan,Hun Soldier,Arrrrr.
Mulan,Mushu ,"Nope.  Mulan!    Man, you are one lucky bug. [Cut to Mulan riding Khan above the snow into the teeth of the avalanche.  Khan and Mulan are swept under by the snow and reemerge quickly.  She looks back and sees Shang passed out riding the wave of snow]"
Mulan,Mulan ,"Shang, Shang!  [Mulan turns around and rides to Shang's position.  She picks him up and places him on Khan.  She turns Khan around again to be riding upstream]"
Mulan,Chien-Po,Do you see them?
Mulan,Yao ,Yes!   Perfect!  Now I'll pull them to safe--[Yao grasps at air as the rope completely passed through his hands]--ty.
Mulan,Mushu ,"Hey Mulan, I found a lucky cricket."
Mulan,Mulan ,We need help!
Mulan,Mushu ,"Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit by me.  [Mushu sees that they're about to fall over the cliff.  He and Cri-Kee look frightened] Ahhhhh!  We're gonna die!  We're gonna die!  I know we're gonna die!  No way we can survive this!  Death is coming!"
Mulan,Yao ,"I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands.  He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers grab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff]"
Mulan,Yao,"Pull [Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers.  He lifts them all up and pulls backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu and Cri-Kee to safety]"
Mulan,Mushu,I knew we could to it.  You da man.  Well sorta.
Mulan,Ling,"Step back guys, give 'em some air."
Mulan,Shang ,"Ping, you are the craziest man I've ever met.  And for that I owe you my life.  From now on, you have my trust."
Mulan,Ling,Let's hear it for Ping!  The bravest of us all.
Mulan,Yao ,You're king of the mountain!
Mulan,Chien-Po ,"Yes, yes, yes!"
Mulan,Mulan ,"Ahhh,"
Mulan,Shang,"Ping, what's wrong? He's wounded, get help! Ping, hold on.  Hold on. [Cut to outside of the medic tent.  Mulan and Medic are inside.  Shang stands by the entrance.  Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite concerned.  Ling drums his fingers on his knees.  The medic comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang.  Shang looks astonished and goes into the tent.  Mulan is lying down.  She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.  She sits up allowing the blanket to fall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on her chest.  She sees Shang's surprised look and realizes her feminine form is noticeable]"
Mulan,Mulan ,"Huh,  I can explain."
Mulan,Chi Fu ,Huh?  So it's true.
Mulan,Mulan ,Shang!
Mulan,Chi Fu,I knew there was something wrong with you.    A woman.
Mulan,Chi Fu ,Trecherous snake.
Mulan,Mulan ,My name is Mulan.  I did it to save my father.
Mulan,Chi Fu ,High treason!
Mulan,Mulan,I didn't mean for it to go this far.
Mulan,Chi Fu ,Ultimate dishonor.
Mulan,Mulan,It was the only way.  Please believe me.
Mulan,Chi Fu ,"Hmph, Captain?"
Mulan,Chi Fu ,"Restrain him. Yao, Ling and Chien-Po :  Noooooo!"
Mulan,Chi Fu ,You know the law. [Shang stands over Mulan.  Mulan looks at Shang then bows her head in anticipation.  Shang lifts the sword high above his head and throws it down in front of Mulan]
Mulan,Shang,A life for a life.  My debt is repaid.    Move out!
Mulan,Chi Fu ,But you can't just...
Mulan,Shang ,"I said, ""Move out!"" [The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and Mushu.  Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn't get warm, he moves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick]"
Mulan,Mushu,"I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks up a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire]  Hi."
Mulan,Mulan ,I should never have left home.
Mulan,Mushu,"Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life.  Who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all your friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go ."
Mulan,Mulan,Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]
Mulan,Mushu ,"Well that's because this just needs a little spit, that's all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping the spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.  [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by his actions, he shows sorrow on his face]  The truth is we're both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don't even like me.  I mean, you risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  ."
Mulan,Cri-Kee ,"Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl."
Mulan,Mushu,What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?     And what are you? A sheep?
Mulan,Mulan ,I'll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let's go home.
Mulan,Mushu,"Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll finish.   I promise."
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,"Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh! [Hun Archer, Long-Hair Hun Man, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Bald Man #1, and Hun Bald Man #2 each pop out of the snow and join Shan-Yu.  They set off towards the Imperial City]"
Mulan,Mulan ,"Huh.  [Mulan runs, grabs her sword, mounts Khan, and heads out following the Huns to the Imperial City]"
Mulan,Mushu,Home is that way!
Mulan,Mulan,I have to do something.
Mulan,Mushu,"Did you see those Huns!?  They popped out of the snow, like daisies!"
Mulan,Mulan,Are we in this together or not?
Mulan,Cri-Kee ,"Chirp, Chirp."
Mulan,Mushu,"Well, let's go kick some Huny buns!    Wu Hu Ha Ga, Wu Hu Ha Ga [Cut to the victory parade in the Imperial City.  Fireworks go off, kites are flying.  The drummers march by, followed by the flutist, followed by the acrobats.  The Parade Leader follows, then Shang and his men, followed by lion dancers]"
Mulan,Parade Leader,"Make way for the heros of China. [Shang leads the men on horseback, all have sorrowful looks on their faces.  Mulan rides up through the crowd and stops.  She looks around and sees Shang in the parade]"
Mulan,Mulan ,Shang!
Mulan,Shang ,Mulan?
Mulan,Mulan,"The Huns are alive, they're in the city."
Mulan,Shang,"You don't belong here Mulan, go home."
Mulan,Mulan ,"Shang, I saw them in the mountains.  You have to believe me."
Mulan,Shang,Why should I?
Mulan,Mulan ,Why else would I come back?  You said you'd trust Ping.  Why is Mulan any different?
Mulan,Mulan ,Keep your eyes open.  I know they're here.  Hya.
Mulan,Mushu,Now where are you going?
Mulan,Mulan ,To find someone who will believe me. [Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor on the steps of the palace.  Chi Fu stands next to Shang and gives him Shan-Yu's sword.  The Lion dancers stop behind Shang.  A palace man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent]
Mulan,Emperor,"My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom.  China will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors."
Mulan,Mulan ,"Sir, the Emperor's in danger! [Man #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan's touch and moves away]   But the Huns are here!    Please, you have to help me.  [Man #2 walks away from Mulan]   No one will listen!"
Mulan,Mushu,"Huh?  Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something?"
Mulan,Mulan ,Mushu!
Mulan,Mushu,"Hey, you're a girl again, remember?"
Mulan,Shang ,"Your Majesty, I present to you the sword of Shan-Yu."
Mulan,Emperor,"I know what this means to you, Captain Li.  Your father would have been very proud. [Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry the Emperor into the Palace.  Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating into the Palace to threaten would be rescue attempts]"
Mulan,Shang ,No.
Mulan,Yao ,C'mon.
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,"Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha. [Shang and his soldiers pick up a big stone statue and use it as a battering ram.  They are unsuccessful at opening the door.  Mulan sees what's going on and arrives at the steps]"
Mulan,Mulan ,"They'll never reach the Emperor in time.  [She looks at the columns and runs near to the Shang and his soldiers.  She whistles loudly catching the soldiers' attention]  Hey guys, I've got an idea. We must be swift as the coursing river With all the force of a great typhoon With all the strength of a raging fire Mysterious as the dark side of the moon [Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue and follow Mulan.  Shang looks astonished.  Around the corner Yao, Ling and Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and dress as women.  Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes and prepare to shimmy up the columns.  Shang arrives and taps Mulan on the shoulder.  He takes off his cape and wraps it around the column to signify that he's coming along.  They shimmy up the poles together]"
Mulan,Shan-Yu,"Boo.    Guard the door [they walk off down the stairs that lead to the balcony].    Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn.  Bow to me. [Cut to the entrance to the stairwell that leads to the balcony.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 come down the stairs and close the door, joining Hun Archer Man, Hun Strong Man and Hun Long-Hair Man.  Mulan and company are around the corner]"
Mulan,Mulan ,"Okay, any questions?"
Mulan,Yao ,Does this dress make me look fat?   Ow.
Mulan,Hun Archer,Who's there?
Mulan,Hun Bald Man #2 ,Concubines.
Mulan,Hun Bald Man #1,Ugly concubines.
Mulan,Ling ,Oh he's so cute. [Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back.  Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2.  A bitten apple falls out from beneath Ling's dress.  He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss of figure]
Mulan,Shang ,Aww.
Mulan,Mushu ,"Now that's what I call Mongolian Barbeque.  [Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter.  The stunned falcon doesn't do anything] [Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling.  Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull out the fruit they were using to simulate a woman's chest.  Chien-Po takes his watermelons and smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2.  He then smashes their two heads together and they fall to the ground.  Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the stomach causing Hun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground.  Ling uses his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back.  Hun Strong Guy lunges his fist at Yao and misses, he misses with the other.  Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks away Hun Archer Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning her back to Hun Archer.  She follows with a left elbow to the stomach followed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground.  She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull his head back]"
Mulan,Mulan ,"Shang, GO!"
Mulan,Shan-Yu,I tire of your arrogance old man.  [yelling and putting his sword at the emperor's throat] Bow to me!
Mulan,Emperor,"No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it."
Mulan,Shan-Yu,"Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword.  Shang swipes with his sword.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge.  Shang grabs onto a column and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu falls to the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls over forcing Shang to be on his back underneath him.  Shang uses his knee to hit Shan-Yu from behind as he uses his hand to hit him in the head.  Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his arm pulling it behind Shan-Yu's back.  Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the balcony from the stairs]"
Mulan,Mulan,"Chien-Po, get the Emperor."
Mulan,Chien-Po ,"Sorry, your Majesty. [Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column in the balcony.  Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground.  Shan Yu watches the Emperor leave]"
Mulan,Shan-Yu,No! [Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face.  Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang and throws him to the ground.  Shang lies limp.  Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over the edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground.  Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight]
Mulan,Yao ,"Come on! [Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look.  Shan-Yu begins to approach Mulan and the rope. Mulan looks at the approaching Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking quickly, Mulan grabs Shan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope.  Shan-Yu reaches the edge and grabs for the falling rope unsuccessfully as Mulan leaves the sword embedded in the column and runs to Shang's position.  The crowd cheers]"
Mulan,Shan-Yu,"No!  [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the Emperor among the throng of people]  Yrraaaaahhhh! [Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang.  Shan-Yu pulls out his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them.  As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, he puts his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife.  Mulan slides away. Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by the shirt collar]"
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,"You, you took away my victory."
Mulan,Mulan,No!  I did!
Mulan,Shan-Yu ,The soldier from the mountains. [Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs and through the doors to the balcony.  She closes the door with the latch falling in place right behind her.  She leans against the doors.  Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his fist. Mulan runs away from the doors down the corridor.  Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a horse catches up with Mulan]
Mulan,Mushu,So what's the plan?
Mulan,Mulan,Ummmm.
Mulan,Mushu,You don't have a plan?!
Mulan,Mulan,"Hey, I'm making this up as I... go. Mushu--"
Mulan,Mushu,I'm way ahead of you sister.  C'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower] [Cut to Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword wildly knocking down a support column with every swipe.  Mulan runs and ducks his every blow. Mulan climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach.  Shan-Yu slices the base of the column causing it to fall and break through the outer wall.  Mulan screams as the beam falls and comes to a stop.  Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning.  She looks off to her right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower] [Zoom in on the fireworks tower.  Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework lighters) on the edge of the tower]
Mulan,Mushu,"Citizens, I need firepower."
Mulan,Barry Cook,Who are you?
Mulan,Mushu ,You're worst nightmare.
Mulan,Man in Crowd #1,On the roof.
Mulan,Man in Crowd #2,"Look! [Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way.  Shan-Yu breaks through the roof behind Mulan surprising her.  Mulan backs away and searches for something on her person to help her against Shan-Yu.  She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it]"
Mulan,Shan-Yu,It looks like you're out of ideas. [Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through the fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that Shan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping off the fan with her sword movement]
Mulan,Mulan,"Not quite.    Ready, Mushu?"
Mulan,Mushu ,"I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework]  Light me!  [Cri-Kee lights the fuse] [Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and stabs it into Shan-Yu's cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan lies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to run, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly propelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the rocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the roof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]"
Mulan,Mulan ,"Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof. [The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to fly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the ground.  Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by]"
Mulan,Mushu ,Ah ha ha ha ha.   [to Cri-Kee]  You are a lucky bug.
Mulan,Chi Fu ,"That was a deliberate attempt on my life.  Where is she?  Now she's done it.  What a mess.  [Shang and troops push Mulan behind them to protect her]  Stand aside, that creature's not worth protecting."
Mulan,Shang ,She's a hero.
Mulan,Chi Fu,'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything.
Mulan,Shang ,"Listen, you pompous--"
Mulan,Emperor ,That is enough!
Mulan,Shang,"Your Majesty, I can explain. [The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside.  Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clear path to Mulan.  Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor.  Chi Fu with a sinister look waits to write down the words of the Emperor]"
Mulan,Emperor,"I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father's armor, ran away from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army, destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all. [Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan. Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit.  Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believing what she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on the ground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her.  Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]"
Mulan,Mushu,My little baby's all grown up and savin' China.   You have a tissue?
Mulan,Emperor,"Chi Fu,"
Mulan,Chi Fu,Your Excellency?
Mulan,Emperor,See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.
Mulan,Chi Fu ,"A member of your coun... what?  But there are no council positions open, your Majesty."
Mulan,Emperor ,"Very well then, you can have his job ."
Mulan,Chi Fu ,What?...My...
Mulan,Mulan ,"With all due respect, your Excellency.  I have been away from home long enough."
Mulan,Emperor ,"Then take this, so your family will know what you have done for me.  And this   so the world will know what you have done for China."
Mulan,Yao,Is she allowed to do that? [Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling.  Chien-Po comes up and lifts all three of them off the ground in a big bear hug.  Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground again.  Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him.  As Shang begins to speak Mulan starts to smile anticipating something good]
Mulan,Shang,Um...  You...  You fight good.
Mulan,Mulan ,"Oh, thank you."
Mulan,Shang,:  Hmm.
Mulan,Mulan,"Khan, let's go home. [Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground level.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]"
Mulan,Emperor ,The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.
Mulan,Shang ,Sir?
Mulan,Emperor,"You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks back up the steps to his palace] [Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree.   A blossom falls and lands on his leg.  Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father.  Fa Zhou sees her approaching and starts to stand]"
Mulan,Fa Zhou,Mulan.
Mulan,Mulan,"Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu  and the crest of the Emperor .   They're gifts to honor the Fa Family. [Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of Mulan. He bends down and holds her arms outstretched]"
Mulan,Fa Zhou,"The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.  [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan's tear then hugs Mulan]  I've missed you so."
Mulan,Mulan,I've missed you too Baba.
Mulan,Fa Li ,Ahhhhh
Mulan,Grandma Fa,"Great, she brings home a sword.  If you ask me she should have brought home a ma--"
Mulan,Shang ,"Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here? [Grandma Fa's mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward Mulan's position.  Shang walks toward Mulan and Fa Zhou]"
Mulan,Grandma Fa,"Woo, sign me up for the next war."
Mulan,Shang ,"Honorable Fa Zhou I--Mulan [Mulan steps up. Shang sees her and speaks insecurely] Uh...Uh...You forgot your helmet.  Ah but well, actually it's your helmet, isn't it?... I mean..."
Mulan,Mulan,Would you like to stay for dinner?
Mulan,Grandma Fa ,Would you like to stay forever? [Mulan shakes her head with a smile at Grandma Fa's statement]
Mulan,Shang ,Dinner would be great. [Cut to First Ancestor grinning happily looking at the scene through the temple window.  He watches Mulan hand the helmet back to Fa Zhou.  Mushu climbs up to the window sill by First Ancestor's his head]
Mulan,Mushu ,"C'mon, who did a good job?  C'mon, tell me who did a good job."
Mulan,First Ancestor ,"Oh, all right.  You can be a guardian again."
Mulan,Mushu,Yeeeeeahhhhhhh.  [Mushu runs to his post and Cri-Kee bangs the gong awakening all the ancestors]
Mulan,Mushu,Take it Cri-Kee.
Mulan,Ancestor 3 ,She get's it from my side of the family.
Mulan,Mushu ,Call out for egg rolls!
Mulan,First Ancestor ,Guardians. [Mushu lands on the steps outside the temple.  Mulan walks up to him and rests besides him on the steps]
Mulan,Mulan,"Thanks, Mushu ."
Mulan,Little Brother,"Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark [Little brother runs up the steps and into the temple with the bag of grain tied to him.  The chickens follow him in]"
Mulan,First Ancestor ,Mushu!
