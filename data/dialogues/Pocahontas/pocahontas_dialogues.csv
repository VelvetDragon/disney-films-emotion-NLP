Pocahontas,Englishman,Ready to hoist the cannon?
Pocahontas,Englishman,Aye!
Pocahontas,Lon,"Hey, look! Is that Smith?"
Pocahontas,Ben,"That’s him, all right, the old sea dog."
Pocahontas,Thomas,Captain John Smith! I’ve heard some amazing stories about him.
Pocahontas,Lon,"Are you coming on this voyage, too?"
Pocahontas,Ben,"‘Course he is, you half-wit. You can’t fight Indians without John Smith."
Pocahontas,John Smith,That’s right. I’m not about to let you boys have all the fun.
Pocahontas,English Chorus,On the beaches of Virginny
Pocahontas,Englishman,Full anchor release!
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Come on, lads, come on!"
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Give me a hand, someone!"
Pocahontas,Englishman,Watch out!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Faster! She’s taking up more water!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Look out!
Pocahontas,Thomas,John! Get down here! The cannons are breaking loose!
Pocahontas,John Smith,Reef the topsails!
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Aye, sir!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Steady on the course. It’s all right, Thomas. We’ll get her tied off."
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Say your prayers, lad!"
Pocahontas,Englishman,Look out!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Oh no!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Thomas, watch out!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,Help!
Pocahontas,Thomas,Help!
Pocahontas,Ben,Stay your course. He’s lost.
Pocahontas,Thomas,Help!
Pocahontas,John Smith,Pull the pin!
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Aye, sir!"
Pocahontas,Ben,Smith! Smith! Are you crazy?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Hang on, Thomas. I’ve got you."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Quick, the rope!"
Pocahontas,Ben,"Heave! Come on, lads, pull! Pull! Pull! Put your back into it!"
Pocahontas,Englishman,Pull! Pull!
Pocahontas,Lon,Hang on!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Yeah!
Pocahontas,Ben,"There, me lucky lad."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, that was refreshing."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Well done, Smith."
Pocahontas,John Smith,Of course. You’d all do the same for me.
Pocahontas,Ben,"Oh, sure, sure, of course we would."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Yes yes, yes. We would."
Pocahontas,Ben,Absolutely.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Trouble on deck?
Pocahontas,Thomas,Governor Ratcliffe!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Thomas fell overboard, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Thank heavens he’s been successfully retrieved. Well done, Smith."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Thank you, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Don’t lose heart, men. It won’t be long before we reach the New World, and remember what awaits us there: freedom—"
Pocahontas,Percy,[Bark.]
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Prosperity—
Pocahontas,Percy,[Bark bark.]
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"The adventure of our lives. You are the finest crew England has to offer and nothing, not wind nor rain nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages shall stand in our way. Carry on men!"
Pocahontas,Englishmen,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Wiggins,A stirring oration sir. I’m sure the men were most exhilarated.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Let us hope so. I’ll need those witless peasants to dig up my gold, won’t I?"
Pocahontas,Thomas,"This New World’s going to be great, John. I’m going to get a pile of gold, build me a big house and if any Indian tries to stop me, I’ll blast him."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You just worry about that fortune of yours, Thomas. Leave the savages to me."
Pocahontas,Lon,You think they’ll give us much trouble?
Pocahontas,Ben,Not as much trouble as Smith’ll give them!
Pocahontas,Englishmen,We’ll kill ourselves an Injun
Pocahontas,John Smith,Or maybe two or three
Pocahontas,Thomas,What do you suppose the New World will look like?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Like all the others, I suppose. I’ve seen hundreds of New Worlds, Thomas. What could possibly be different about this one?"
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"It’s glory, God and gold"
Pocahontas,Native Americans,Hega hega ya-hi-ye hega
Pocahontas,Kekata,Ka-ma wingapo Powhatan.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Ay-man-ay-cho, Kekata. It’s good to be home. Chesk-cham-ay! The Massawomecks are defeated! With the help of our brothers, our villages are safe again!"
Pocahontas,Native Americans,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Kekata,Your return has brought much joy to the village. Look at all the smiling faces.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Yes, but there is one smiling face I don’t see. Where is my daughter?"
Pocahontas,Kekata,You know Pocahontas. She has her mother’s spirit. She goes wherever the wind takes her.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Pocahontas! Your father’s back! Come down here!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"He’s back, Flit! Come on, Meeko."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"No, not that… way."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Show-off. Pocahontas? Pocahontas? Are you all right? Well, you better be all right because I’m not coming in after you…! [Coughs.] Don’t you think we’re getting a little old for these games?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Help me turn this thing over.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,What were you doing up there?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Thinking. Meeko!
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"About the dream again? Oh, have you figured it out yet?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"I know it means something, I just don’t know what."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,You should ask your father about it.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Maybe I should. Come on, Flit. Quit playing around, we have to get back."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"…faced a determined enemy. The battle lasted from the rising of the sun until the evening shadows fell. Our warriors fought with courage, but none as bravely as Kocoum. He attacked with the fierce strength of the bear. He has proven himself to be the greatest…"
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Oh, he’s so handsome."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I especially love his smile.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,… destroying every enemy in his path. Tonight we will feast in his honor.
Pocahontas,Native Americans,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Powhatan,My daughter.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Wingapo, father."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Seeing you gives me great joy.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I am so glad you’ve come home safely.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Come with me, we have much to talk about. I want to hear everything you’ve been doing."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Father, for many nights now I’ve been having a very strange dream. I think it’s telling me something’s about to happen, something exciting."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Yes, something exciting is about to happen."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Really, what is it?"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Marry Kocoum?
Pocahontas,Powhatan,I told him it would make my heart soar.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,But he’s so… serious.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"My daughter, Kocoum will make a fine husband. He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house with sturdy walls. With him you will be safe from harm."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,This is the right path for you.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,But why can’t I choose—
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Pocahontas, come with me. You are the daughter of the chief. It is time to take your place among our people. Even the wild mountain stream must someday join the big river."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,He wants me to be steady… Like the river. But it’s not steady at all.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Is that my Pocahontas?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Grandmother Willow, I need to talk to you."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Good morning, child. I was hoping you’d visit today. Why, your mother’s necklace!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. My father wants me to marry Kocoum.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Kocoum? But he’s so serious.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I know. My father thinks it’s the right path for me. But lately I’ve been having this dream and I think it’s—
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Oh, a dream! Let’s hear all about it!"
Pocahontas,Animals,[Chatter.]
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Quiet! Quiet!
Pocahontas,Frog,[Ribbit.]
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Now, child, you were saying."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Well, I’m running through the woods and then right there in front of me is an arrow. As I look at it, it starts to spin."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,A spinning arrow? How unusual.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Yes! It spins faster and faster and faster until suddenly it stops.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Hmm. Well, seems to me this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"But Grandmother Willow, what is my path? How am I ever going to find it?"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,[Chuckle.] Your mother asked me the very same question.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,She did? What did you tell her?
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"I told her to listen. All around you are spirits, child. They live in the earth, the water, the sky. If you listen, they will guide you."
Pocahontas,Wind Spirits,Ay ay ay na ay ay na
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I hear the wind.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Yes, what is it telling you?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I don’t understand.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Que que na-to-ra
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,It’s saying something’s coming! Strange clouds?
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Listen with your heart
Pocahontas,Wind Spirits,You will understand
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,What do you see?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Clouds. Strange clouds.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Look at it, Wiggins. An entire New World chock full of gold, just waiting for me."
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"And scores of adventures waiting for us, right, Percy? Do you think we’ll meet some savages?"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"If we do, we should be sure to give them a proper English greeting."
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"Oh, gift baskets!"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,And he came so highly recommended.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"It’s perfect, Governor. The water’s deep enough, we can pull right up to shore. Hey there, Percy."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Very well, then. Give the order."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Already done, sir. I’ve got a crew assembled and they’re ready to go."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"About the natives, I’m counting on you to make sure those filthy heathens don’t disrupt our mission."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, if they’re anything like the savages I’ve fought before, it’s nothing I can’t handle."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Right. That’ll be all, Smith, there’s a good man."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"See ya, Percy."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"The men like Smith, don’t they? I’ve never been a popular man."
Pocahontas,Wiggins,I like you.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,And don’t think I don’t know what those backstabbers at court say about me.
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"Oh yes, all that talk about you being a pathetic social climber who’s failed at everything he’s—"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"I’m very well aware that this is my last chance for glory. But mark my words, Wiggins, when King James see the gold these peasants unearth success will be mine, at last."
Pocahontas,Ben,Wake up! Shake a leg!
Pocahontas,Lon,It’s incredible.
Pocahontas,Thomas,And it’s all ours. I’ve never seen anything like it.
Pocahontas,Ben,"It can look like Ratcliffe’s knickers, for all I care, just as long as we get off this stinking boat."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Come on, men, we didn’t come all this way just to look at it."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Keep it taut, lads, keep it taut! Steady, steady."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Ah, that’s far enough! All right now, tie her off."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Here, John, tie up this end. John? John? What are you doing up there?"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Getting a better look. [Meeko bumps into him.] Hey! Well, you’re a strange-looking fellow. You hungry? Here you go, it’s a biscuit. It’s food… Well, sort of. You like it, eh? Well, try eating it for four months straight. You got a friend back there? [Flit attacks him.] Hey, what, what, watch out! No… Get that… Look out!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,John! You better get down here! The Governor’s coming ashore!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"All right, all right, I’m leaving."
Pocahontas,Native American,Did you see their skin? Pale and sickly.
Pocahontas,Native American,They have hair on their faces like dogs.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"My brothers, we must know more about these visitors. Kekata, what do you see?"
Pocahontas,Kekata,"[Chanting.] These are not men like us, but strange beasts with bodies that shine like the sun and weapons that spout fire and thunder. They prowl the earth like ravenous wolves consuming everything in their path."
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Great Powhatan. I will lead our warriors to the river and attack. We will destroy these invaders the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Kocoum, in that battle we knew how to fight our enemy, but these pale visitors are strange to us. Take some men to the river to observe them. Let us hope they do not intend to stay."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"I hereby claim this land and all its riches in the name of His Majesty King James the first, and do so name this settlement Jamestown."
Pocahontas,Englishmen,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"Bravo! Bravo! Beautifully spoken, sir! Hurry now, Percy. We must be all squeaky clean for the New World. [Exits.]"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Captain Smith! It appears I’ve selected the perfect location, eh? Not a savage in sight."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Just because we don’t see them doesn’t mean they’re not out there, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Well then, perhaps you should venture forth and determine their whereabouts, hmm?"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"If there are any Indians out there, I’ll find them."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Now, gentlemen, to work. You men, get the ship unloaded."
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Right, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,You men build the fort. The rest of you… Break out the shovels! It’s time to start digging.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Why, of course! Let’s not forget what the Spanish found when they came to the New World. Gold, mountains of it. Why, for years they’ve been ravaging the New World of its most precious resources but now… It’s our turn."
Pocahontas,Englishmen,Dig and dig and dig and diggety
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Hey nonny nonny
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Ooh, how I love it"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Hey nonny nonny
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Riches for cheap
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Hey nonny nonny
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,There’ll be heaps of it
Pocahontas,Englishmen,Dig and dig and dig and diggety
Pocahontas,John Smith,All of my life I have searched for land like this one
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Keep on working, lads"
Pocahontas,John Smith,Mine
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Don’t be shirking, lads"
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"Dig, dig, and diggety"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Beautiful gold
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"Dig, dig, for that gold"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Make the mounds big, boys"
Pocahontas,John Smith,This land we behold
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,This beauty untold
Pocahontas,John Smith,A man can be bold
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,It all can be sold
Pocahontas,Englishmen,So go for the gold
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Is
Pocahontas,Englishmen,All the riches here
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Mine
Pocahontas,Englishmen,From this minute
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Mine
Pocahontas,Englishmen,This land and what’s in it is
Pocahontas,All,Mine
Pocahontas,Englishmen,Dig and dig and diggety-dig
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, wait! Please! Please! Don’t run off. It’s all right, I’m not gonna hurt you. Here, let me help you out of there."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Mat-ta-que na-to-rath.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You don’t understand a word I’m saying, do you? It’s all right."
Pocahontas,Wind Spirit,Ay ay ay na ay ay na
Pocahontas,John Smith,Who are you?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Pocahontas.
Pocahontas,John Smith,What? What did you say?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,My name is Pocahontas.
Pocahontas,John Smith,I’m John Smith.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"That’s it. Keep at it, men. Keep digging. It’s got to be here somewhere."
Pocahontas,Namontack,"There’s thirty more of them, down by the ridge."
Pocahontas,Kocoum,That makes more than a hundred.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Anything yet?
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Um, how long are we gonna keep digging like this, sir?"
Pocahontas,Ben,"Aye, we’re slaving away, busting our backs, day and night—"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"For king and country, I know, I know, and I share your fatigue. Wiggins! Wiggins!"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Coming!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Dispose of this.
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"[To Percy.] Who’s a good doggy? Who’s a good doggy? Fetch, boy!"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Savages! It’s an ambush, arm yourselves!"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Run!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Arm yourselves! Make sure every man has a musket! Shoot! [Thomas trips over a log and his rifle goes off accidentally, firing right between Ratcliffe's legs.] Them, you idiot! Where’s that blasted Smith when I need him?"
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Namontack!
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Back to the village!
Pocahontas,Englishmen,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Ben,"Aye, Governor!"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,[To Thomas.] And you! Learn to use that thing properly. A man’s not a man unless he knows how to shoot.
Pocahontas,Kekata,[Chanting.]
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"These beasts invade our shores, and now this."
Pocahontas,Kekata,[Chanting.] This wound is strange to me.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"We will fight this enemy, but we cannot do it alone. Kocoum, send messengers to every village in our nation. We will call on our brothers to help us fight. [Steps outside the tent.] These White Men are dangerous! No one is to go near them."
Pocahontas,John Smith,It’s called a helmet.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Helmet.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"So, what river is this?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Quiyoughcohannock.
Pocahontas,John Smith,You have most unusual names here. Chicahominy. Quiyough - Quiyoughcohannock. Pocahontas.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"You have the most unusual name, too. John Smith."
Pocahontas,John Smith,[Pulls Meeko out of his bag.] Hey! Is this bottomless pit a friend of yours?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Meeko!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Nothing’s happening.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, no, I need your hand first. It’s how we say hello."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,This is how we say hello. Wingapo.
Pocahontas,John Smith,Wingapo.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,And how we say goodbye. Ana.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"I like hello better. [Flit charges at him.] Yeah, I remember you."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Flit just doesn’t like strangers.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"But I’m not a stranger anymore. Hmm, stubborn little fellow, isn’t he?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Very stubborn.
Pocahontas,John Smith,Hey!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Meeko! Come back here!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Don’t worry, he can’t hurt it. [Meeko hits it against a rock.] Hey, what are you doing?!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Meeko bring that back!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, no, it’s all right. He can keep it. Call it a gift."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What was that?
Pocahontas,John Smith,My compass.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Compass?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"It tells you how to find your way when you get lost. But it’s all right, I’ll get another one in London."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,London? Is that your village?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Yes, it’s a very big village."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What’s it like?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, it’s got streets filled with carriages and bridges over the rivers and buildings as tall as trees."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’d like to see those things.
Pocahontas,John Smith,You will.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,How?
Pocahontas,John Smith,We’re going to build them here. We’ll show your people how to use this land properly. How to make the most of it.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Make the most of it?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Yes, we’ll build roads and decent houses and—"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Our houses are fine.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You think that, only because you don’t know any better. [Pocahontas starts to leave.] Wait a minute, don’t take it that – [Flit attacks him.] Hey, hey, wait! Wait, wait! There’s so much we can teach you. We’ve improved the lives of savages all over the world."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Savages?!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Uh, not that you’re a savage."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Just my people.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, listen, that’s not what I meant. Let me explain—"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Let go!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, I’m not letting you leave. Look, don’t do this. ‘Savage’ is just a word. You know. A term for… people who are uncivilized."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Like me.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, when I say uncivilized, what I mean is – is…"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"What you mean is, not like you."
Pocahontas,John Smith,What is it?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,The drums. They mean trouble. I shouldn’t be here.
Pocahontas,John Smith,I want to see you again.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I can’t.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Please, don’t leave."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’m sorry. I have to go.
Pocahontas,Ben,All right! This one’s ready to hoist!
Pocahontas,Lon,"Two on each side. Ready now, push! Watch it, it’s slipping!"
Pocahontas,Ben,"Come on, lads, it’s only a little picket fence."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Steady, steady!"
Pocahontas,Ben,There you go!
Pocahontas,Thomas,"That’ll keep everything out, eh, John? Something wrong, John?"
Pocahontas,John Smith,What?
Pocahontas,Thomas,You’ve been awfully quiet the last few days.
Pocahontas,Lon,"Oh, he’s just mad that he missed all the action."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Ah, don’t worry, John. You’ll get your chance to deal with the Indians."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Yeah, we’ll take care of them like that we did last time, eh mates?"
Pocahontas,Ben,"All right, you howling nutter, get to work!"
Pocahontas,Lon,"Come on, Ben. It’s just a little fun."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Oh sure, we’re having loads of fun. Right, look at us. No gold, no food, while Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day happy as a clam."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"I’m doomed! I should be wallowing in riches right now and I haven’t seen so much as a speck! It’s got to be here somewhere. Where could it be? I’ve mined the forests and the hills and swamps, and nothing! Why can’t I find it? What am I overlooking?"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Ah!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,[Gasp.]
Pocahontas,Wiggins,I… I… I made it myself.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Take that silly… Of course, the Indians! Wiggins, why do you think those insolent heathens attacked us?"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Because we invaded their land and cut down their trees and dug up their earth?
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"It’s the gold! They have it and they don’t want us to take it from them. Well, I’ll just have to take it by force then, won’t I?"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,You there! Where’s Captain Smith?
Pocahontas,Lon,"Well, he’s… gone!"
Pocahontas,Ben,"Aye, your singing must have scared him off."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Well, then go get him, for heaven’s sake!"
Pocahontas,Lon,What if we run into the Indians?
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"That’s what guns are for, now arm yourselves and get moving!"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Pocahontas! You should be inside the village.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,We’ll be all right.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,We’re gathering food for when the warriors arrive.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Don’t go far. Now is not the time to be running off.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Yes, father."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"When I see you wear that necklace, you look just like your mother."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I miss her.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"But she is still with us. Whenever the wind blows through the trees, I feel her presence. Our people looked to her for wisdom and strength. Someday, they will look to you as well."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I would be honored by that.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,You shouldn’t be out here alone. I’ll send for Kocoum. [Exits.]
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What?
Pocahontas,Nakoma,You’re hiding something.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’m not hiding anything.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, you can tell me, I promise I won’t tell anyone —"
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"[Gasp.] Pocahontas, look! It’s one of them! I’m going to get— [Pocahontas covers her mouth.]"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What are you doing here?
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Mmm?!
Pocahontas,John Smith,I had to see you again.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Mmm!
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Mmm!
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Please, don’t say anything. Quick, this way."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,But—
Pocahontas,Kocoum,"Nakoma, where is Pocahontas?"
Pocahontas,Nakoma,I… I haven’t seen her.
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Pocahontas can’t keep running off. It’s dangerous out there. Tell her that. She listens to you.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Huh, sure she does."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"This place is incredible! And to think, we came all this way just to dig it up for gold."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Gold?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Hey, Meeko."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What’s gold?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You know, it’s… It’s yellow, comes out of the ground, it’s really valuable."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Oh, here, we’ve lots of it. [Takes out an ear of corn.] Gold."
Pocahontas,John Smith,No… Gold is this. [Takes out a gold coin.]
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Hmm, there’s nothing like that around here."
Pocahontas,John Smith,No gold?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Not that I’ve seen.
Pocahontas,John Smith,[Laughs.] All this way for nothing. Those boys are in for a big surprise.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Will they leave?
Pocahontas,John Smith,Some of them might.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Will you go home?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, it’s not like I have much of a home to go back to. I’ve never really belonged anywhere."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,You could belong here.
Pocahontas,Wind Spirit,Ay ay ay na ay ay na…
Pocahontas,John Smith,What was that?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Did you see something?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No… No, I just, uh… I… I didn’t see anything. Did I?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Look again.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Let it break upon you
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Pocahontas, the tree is talking to me."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Then you should talk back.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Don’t be frightened, young man. My bark is worse than my bite."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Say something.
Pocahontas,John Smith,What do you say to a tree?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Anything you want.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"So, uh…"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Come closer, John Smith. He has a good soul. And he’s handsome, too."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Oh, I like her."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I knew you would.
Pocahontas,John Smith,We can’t let them see us.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Quick, over here."
Pocahontas,Lon,This place gives me the creeps. Savages could be hiding anywhere.
Pocahontas,Ben,"Aye, well, if you spot one, don’t ask questions. Just shoot."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Watch your feet, you big oaf!"
Pocahontas,Lon,"It wasn’t me, it was the tree."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Oh of course, the tree just felt like lifting its roots and… Let’s get out of here. Run!"
Pocahontas,Lon,But what about Smith?
Pocahontas,Ben,"He’s a big lad, he can take care of himself."
Pocahontas,John Smith,I’m glad you’re on our side.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,There’s still some snap in these old vines.
Pocahontas,John Smith,I better get back before they send the whole camp out after me.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,When will I see you again?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Meet me tonight, right here. [Exits.]"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Well, I haven’t had this much excitement in 200 years."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"What am I doing? I shouldn’t be seeing him again. I mean, I want to see him again—"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Who wouldn’t? I want to see him again.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"But still, something inside is telling me it’s the right thing."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Perhaps it’s your dream.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,My dream? Do you think he’s the one the spinning arrow was pointing to?
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Mm-hmm!
Pocahontas,Native American,The warriors are here!
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, are you crazy? What were you doing with that—"
Pocahontas,Kocoum,There you are!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Kocoum!
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Look at them. Now we have enough warriors to destroy those white demons!
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Now that we are joined by our brothers, we will defeat this enemy."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Father, I need to speak with you."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Not now, my daughter. The council is gathering."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,We don’t have to fight them! There must be a better way.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,But maybe we should try talking to them.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,They do not want to talk.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"But if one of them did want to talk, you would listen to him, wouldn’t you?"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Pocahontas—
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Wouldn’t you?
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Of course I would. But it is not that simple. Nothing is simple anymore.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Easy, Thomas. It’s me."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Oh, John! I could’ve killed you!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Not aiming like that, you couldn’t. Keep both eyes open when you shoot. You’ll see twice as well."
Pocahontas,Ben,Smith! There ya are!
Pocahontas,Lon,We were looking all over for you.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Smith! Where have you been?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"I was out scouting the terrain, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Excellent. Then you must know the Indians’ whereabouts. We’ll need that information for the battle.
Pocahontas,John Smith,What battle?
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,We will eliminate these savages once and for all.
Pocahontas,John Smith,No! You can’t do that!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Look, we don’t have to fight them."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"John, what’s gotten into you?"
Pocahontas,John Smith,I met one of them.
Pocahontas,Ben,You what?
Pocahontas,Thomas,A savage?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"They’re not savages, they can help us. They know the land, they know how to navigate the rivers. And, look! It’s food!"
Pocahontas,Lon,What is it?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"It’s better than hardtack and gruel, that’s for sure."
Pocahontas,Wiggins,I like gruel.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"They don’t want to feed us, you ninnies! They want to kill us! All of us! They’ve got our gold, and they’ll do anything to keep it!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,But there is no gold!
Pocahontas,Ben,No… gold?
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,And I suppose your little Indian friend told you this.
Pocahontas,John Smith,Yes.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Lies! Lies, all of it! Murderous thieves, there’s no room for their kind in civilized society."
Pocahontas,John Smith,But this is their land!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"This is my land! I make the laws here. And I say anyone so much as looks at an Indian without killing him on sight, will be tried for treason and hanged."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Nakoma!
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Don’t go out there. I lied for you once, don’t ask me to do it again."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I have to do this.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,He’s one of them!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,You don’t know him.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"You go out there, you’ll be turning your back on your own people."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’m trying to help my people.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, please… You’re my best friend, I don’t want you to get hurt."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"I won’t, I know what I’m doing."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, no!"
Pocahontas,Lon,But what if Smith is right? What if there is no gold?
Pocahontas,Englishman,"If you ask me, Ratcliffe’s been lying to us since we left London."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Listen to you, you bunch of idiots. Those savages didn’t attack us for nothing, they’re hiding something."
Pocahontas,Lon,"If they do have the gold, I reckon we’ll have to fight them."
Pocahontas,Thomas,[Gasp.]
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Follow him.
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Yes, Governor."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,I want to know where he’s sneaking off to.
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Yes, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"And if you happen to see any Indians, shoot them. Oh, and Thomas? You’ve been a slipshod sailor and a poor excuse for a soldier. Don’t disappoint me again."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Kocoum?
Pocahontas,Kocoum,What is it?
Pocahontas,Nakoma,It’s Pocahontas.
Pocahontas,Kocoum,What’s wrong? Is she all right?
Pocahontas,Nakoma,I think she’s in trouble.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"The earth is trembling, child. What’s happened?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,The warriors are here!
Pocahontas,John Smith,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,John!
Pocahontas,John Smith,Listen to me. My men are planning to attack your people. You’ve got to warn them.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Maybe it’s not too late to stop this. You have to come with me and talk to my father.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Pocahontas, talking isn’t going to do any good. I already tried talking to my men but everything about this land has them spooked."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,That’s the strangest creature I’ve ever seen!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Percy! Easy, Percy, come here!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Meeko, come back!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You see what I mean? Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Come, come here!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"It’s all right, he’s a friend. Bad, bad dog! Sit!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What are you doing? Meeko!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Percy, get back here! Stop that!"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"All right, that’s enough! It’s enough to make your sap boil. Now then, there’s something I want to show you. Look. [Touches a vine to the river surface.]"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,The ripples.
Pocahontas,John Smith,What about them?
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"So small at first, then look how they grow. But someone has to start them."
Pocahontas,John Smith,They’re not going to listen to us.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Young man, sometimes the right path is not the easiest one. Don’t you see, only when the fighting stops can you can be together."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"All right, let’s go talk to your father."
Pocahontas,Kocoum,[War cry.]
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,[Gasp.]
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Kocoum, no! Kocoum! Leave him alone! [Gasps.] Kocoum, stop!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,[Gasp.]
Pocahontas,John Smith,Thomas!
Pocahontas,Thomas,Is he…?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,You killed him!
Pocahontas,Thomas,I thought that—
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Get away from him!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Pocahontas, it won’t help! He was only—"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,He killed him!
Pocahontas,Native American Warriors,[Shouting.]
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Thomas, get out of here. Get out of here!"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Who did this?
Pocahontas,Native American Warrior,Pocahontas was out in the woods. Kocoum went to find her and this white man attacked them.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Your weapons are strong. But now our anger is stronger. At sunrise he will be the first to die!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,But father!
Pocahontas,Powhatan,I told you to stay in the village. You disobeyed me. You have shamed your father!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I was only trying to help.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Because of your foolishness, Kocoum is dead! Take him away. [Exits.]"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Kocoum was just coming to protect me.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you. I was worried about you. I thought I was doing the right thing."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,All of this happened because of me… And now I’ll never see John Smith again.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Come with me.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes of the man who killed Kocoum.
Pocahontas,Native American Warrior,Be quick.
Pocahontas,John Smith,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’m so sorry.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"For what, this? I’ve gotten out of worse scrapes than this. Can’t think of any right now, but…"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"It would’ve been better if we’d never met, none of this would’ve happened."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Pocahontas, look at me. I’d rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Pocahontas?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I can’t leave you.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You never will. No matter what happens to me, I’ll always be with you. Forever."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Help! Somebody, help! Help! Help!"
Pocahontas,Lon,"Easy, lad. What is it?"
Pocahontas,Thomas,It’s Smith! They got him!
Pocahontas,Ben,Who got him?
Pocahontas,Thomas,The savages!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Savages?
Pocahontas,Thomas,"They captured him, dragged him off!"
Pocahontas,Ben,Where’d they take him?
Pocahontas,Thomas,They headed North!
Pocahontas,Lon,How many were there?
Pocahontas,Thomas,"I don’t know, at least a dozen."
Pocahontas,Ben,Filthy beasts!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"It’s perfect, Wiggins! I couldn’t have planned this better myself. The gold is as good as mine!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,We’ve got to save him! He’d do the same for any of us.
Pocahontas,Ben,Thomas is right! We’ve got to do something.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"And so we shall! I told you those savages couldn’t be trusted. Smith tried to befriend them, and look what they’ve done to him. But now I say it’s time to rescue our courageous comrade. At daybreak, we attack!"
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Barely even human
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Drive them to our shore
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"They’re savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Kekata,Beneath that milky hide
Pocahontas,Native American Warriors,I wonder if they even bleed
Pocahontas,Native Americans,"They’re savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Barely even human
Pocahontas,Native Americans,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Killers at the core
Pocahontas,Powhatan,We must sound the drums of war
Pocahontas,Native Americans,"They’re savages, savages"
Pocahontas,All,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Ben,Let’s go get a few men
Pocahontas,All,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Now it’s up to you, men"
Pocahontas,All,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"They’re going to kill him at sunrise, Grandmother Willow."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,You have to stop them.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I can’t.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Child, remember your dream?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"I was wrong, Grandmother Willow. I followed the wrong path. I feel so lost. [Meeko gives her John’s compass.] The compass? Spinning arrow!"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,It’s the arrow from your dream!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I was right! It was pointing to him. [Sunlight hits her face.] Sunrise!
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"It’s not too late, child. Let the spirits of the earth guide you! You know your path, child… Now follow it!"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,This will be the day
Pocahontas,Powhatan,This will be the morning
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I don’t know what I can do
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Eagle help my feet to fly
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Mountain, help my heart be great"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Spirits of the earth and sky
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Please don’t let it be too late
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,How loud are the drums of war
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Is the death of all I love
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"No! If you kill him you’ll have to kill me, too."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Daughter, stand back!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"I won’t! I love him, father. Look around you. This is where the path of hatred has brought us. This is the path I choose, father. What will yours be?"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"My daughter speaks with wisdom beyond her years. We’ve all come here with anger in our hearts, but she comes with courage and understanding. From this day forward, if there is to be more killing, it will not start with me. Release him."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Now’s our chance, fire!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,No!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,What?
Pocahontas,Thomas,They let him go!
Pocahontas,Ben,They don’t want to fight!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"It’s a trick, don’t you see? Fire! Fine, I’ll settle this myself."
Pocahontas,John Smith,No! [Jumps in the way.]
Pocahontas,Thomas,John! You shot him!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,He stepped right – right into it! It’s his own fault!
Pocahontas,Ben,Smith was right all along!
Pocahontas,Lon,We never should have listened to you!
Pocahontas,Ben,Get the gun!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Traitors! Unhand me, I say, how dare you!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,Put him in chains!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,I’ll see you all hanged for this!
Pocahontas,Thomas,And gag him as well.
Pocahontas,Ben,"Is he going to make it, Thomas?"
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Sooner he gets back to England, the better."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Well, let’s hope the wind is with him."
Pocahontas,Thomas,Is the ship ready yet?
Pocahontas,Ben,Any minute now. Just loading the last bit of cargo.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,(muffled) How dare you! Untie me at once! I’ll have your head for this!
Pocahontas,Wiggins,And he came so highly recommended.
Pocahontas,Thomas,The ship’s almost ready. We’d better get you on board. We’ll lose the tide.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, not yet. She said she’d be here."
Pocahontas,Thomas,Look.
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Going back is his only chance, he’ll die if he stays here."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Here. It’s from Grandmother Willow’s bark. It’ll help with the pain.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"What pain? I’ve had worse pain than this. Can’t think of any right now, but…"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"You are always welcome among our people. Thank you, my brother."
Pocahontas,John Smith,[To Flit.] I thought you didn’t like strangers.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,My mother’s necklace.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"See ya, Percy. [To Pocahontas.] Come with me?"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,You must choose your own path.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’m needed here.
Pocahontas,John Smith,Then I’ll stay with you.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"No, you have to go back."
Pocahontas,John Smith,But I can’t leave you.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"You never will. No matter what happens, I’ll always be with you. Forever. (Singing) And I’m so grateful to you."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Good luck, lad."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Godspeed, John."
Pocahontas,English Chorus,In sixteen hundred seven (1607)
Pocahontas,Englishman,Ready to hoist the cannon?
Pocahontas,Englishman,Aye!
Pocahontas,Lon,"Hey, look! Is that Smith?"
Pocahontas,Ben,"That’s him, all right, the old sea dog."
Pocahontas,Thomas,Captain John Smith! I’ve heard some amazing stories about him.
Pocahontas,Lon,"Are you coming on this voyage, too?"
Pocahontas,Ben,"‘Course he is, you half-wit. You can’t fight Indians without John Smith."
Pocahontas,John Smith,That’s right. I’m not about to let you boys have all the fun.
Pocahontas,English Chorus,On the beaches of Virginny
Pocahontas,Englishman,Full anchor release!
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Come on, lads, come on!"
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Give me a hand, someone!"
Pocahontas,Englishman,Watch out!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Faster! She’s taking up more water!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Look out!
Pocahontas,Thomas,John! Get down here! The cannons are breaking loose!
Pocahontas,John Smith,Reef the topsails!
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Aye, sir!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Steady on the course. It’s all right, Thomas. We’ll get her tied off."
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Say your prayers, lad!"
Pocahontas,Englishman,Look out!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Oh no!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Thomas, watch out!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,Help!
Pocahontas,Thomas,Help!
Pocahontas,Ben,Stay your course. He’s lost.
Pocahontas,Thomas,Help!
Pocahontas,John Smith,Pull the pin!
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Aye, sir!"
Pocahontas,Ben,Smith! Smith! Are you crazy?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Hang on, Thomas. I’ve got you."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Quick, the rope!"
Pocahontas,Ben,"Heave! Come on, lads, pull! Pull! Pull! Put your back into it!"
Pocahontas,Englishman,Pull! Pull!
Pocahontas,Lon,Hang on!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Yeah!
Pocahontas,Ben,"There, me lucky lad."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, that was refreshing."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Well done, Smith."
Pocahontas,John Smith,Of course. You’d all do the same for me.
Pocahontas,Ben,"Oh, sure, sure, of course we would."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Yes yes, yes. We would."
Pocahontas,Ben,Absolutely.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Trouble on deck?
Pocahontas,Thomas,Governor Ratcliffe!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Thomas fell overboard, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Thank heavens he’s been successfully retrieved. Well done, Smith."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Thank you, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Don’t lose heart, men. It won’t be long before we reach the New World, and remember what awaits us there: freedom—"
Pocahontas,Percy,[Bark.]
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Prosperity—
Pocahontas,Percy,[Bark bark.]
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"The adventure of our lives. You are the finest crew England has to offer and nothing, not wind nor rain nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages shall stand in our way. Carry on men!"
Pocahontas,Englishmen,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Wiggins,A stirring oration sir. I’m sure the men were most exhilarated.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Let us hope so. I’ll need those witless peasants to dig up my gold, won’t I?"
Pocahontas,Thomas,"This New World’s going to be great, John. I’m going to get a pile of gold, build me a big house and if any Indian tries to stop me, I’ll blast him."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You just worry about that fortune of yours, Thomas. Leave the savages to me."
Pocahontas,Lon,You think they’ll give us much trouble?
Pocahontas,Ben,Not as much trouble as Smith’ll give them!
Pocahontas,Englishmen,We’ll kill ourselves an Injun
Pocahontas,John Smith,Or maybe two or three
Pocahontas,Thomas,What do you suppose the New World will look like?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Like all the others, I suppose. I’ve seen hundreds of New Worlds, Thomas. What could possibly be different about this one?"
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"It’s glory, God and gold"
Pocahontas,Native Americans,Hega hega ya-hi-ye hega
Pocahontas,Kekata,Ka-ma wingapo Powhatan.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Ay-man-ay-cho, Kekata. It’s good to be home. Chesk-cham-ay! The Massawomecks are defeated! With the help of our brothers, our villages are safe again!"
Pocahontas,Native Americans,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Kekata,Your return has brought much joy to the village. Look at all the smiling faces.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Yes, but there is one smiling face I don’t see. Where is my daughter?"
Pocahontas,Kekata,You know Pocahontas. She has her mother’s spirit. She goes wherever the wind takes her.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Pocahontas! Your father’s back! Come down here!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"He’s back, Flit! Come on, Meeko."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"No, not that… way."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Show-off. Pocahontas? Pocahontas? Are you all right? Well, you better be all right because I’m not coming in after you…! [Coughs.] Don’t you think we’re getting a little old for these games?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Help me turn this thing over.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,What were you doing up there?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Thinking. Meeko!
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"About the dream again? Oh, have you figured it out yet?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"I know it means something, I just don’t know what."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,You should ask your father about it.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Maybe I should. Come on, Flit. Quit playing around, we have to get back."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"…faced a determined enemy. The battle lasted from the rising of the sun until the evening shadows fell. Our warriors fought with courage, but none as bravely as Kocoum. He attacked with the fierce strength of the bear. He has proven himself to be the greatest…"
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Oh, he’s so handsome."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I especially love his smile.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,… destroying every enemy in his path. Tonight we will feast in his honor.
Pocahontas,Native Americans,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Powhatan,My daughter.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Wingapo, father."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Seeing you gives me great joy.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I am so glad you’ve come home safely.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Come with me, we have much to talk about. I want to hear everything you’ve been doing."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Father, for many nights now I’ve been having a very strange dream. I think it’s telling me something’s about to happen, something exciting."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Yes, something exciting is about to happen."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Really, what is it?"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Marry Kocoum?
Pocahontas,Powhatan,I told him it would make my heart soar.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,But he’s so… serious.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"My daughter, Kocoum will make a fine husband. He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house with sturdy walls. With him you will be safe from harm."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,This is the right path for you.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,But why can’t I choose—
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Pocahontas, come with me. You are the daughter of the chief. It is time to take your place among our people. Even the wild mountain stream must someday join the big river."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,He wants me to be steady… Like the river. But it’s not steady at all.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Is that my Pocahontas?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Grandmother Willow, I need to talk to you."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Good morning, child. I was hoping you’d visit today. Why, your mother’s necklace!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. My father wants me to marry Kocoum.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Kocoum? But he’s so serious.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I know. My father thinks it’s the right path for me. But lately I’ve been having this dream and I think it’s—
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Oh, a dream! Let’s hear all about it!"
Pocahontas,Animals,[Chatter.]
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Quiet! Quiet!
Pocahontas,Frog,[Ribbit.]
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Now, child, you were saying."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Well, I’m running through the woods and then right there in front of me is an arrow. As I look at it, it starts to spin."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,A spinning arrow? How unusual.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Yes! It spins faster and faster and faster until suddenly it stops.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Hmm. Well, seems to me this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"But Grandmother Willow, what is my path? How am I ever going to find it?"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,[Chuckle.] Your mother asked me the very same question.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,She did? What did you tell her?
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"I told her to listen. All around you are spirits, child. They live in the earth, the water, the sky. If you listen, they will guide you."
Pocahontas,Wind Spirits,Ay ay ay na ay ay na
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I hear the wind.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Yes, what is it telling you?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I don’t understand.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Que que na-to-ra
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,It’s saying something’s coming! Strange clouds?
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Listen with your heart
Pocahontas,Wind Spirits,You will understand
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,What do you see?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Clouds. Strange clouds.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Look at it, Wiggins. An entire New World chock full of gold, just waiting for me."
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"And scores of adventures waiting for us, right, Percy? Do you think we’ll meet some savages?"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"If we do, we should be sure to give them a proper English greeting."
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"Oh, gift baskets!"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,And he came so highly recommended.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"It’s perfect, Governor. The water’s deep enough, we can pull right up to shore. Hey there, Percy."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Very well, then. Give the order."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Already done, sir. I’ve got a crew assembled and they’re ready to go."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"About the natives, I’m counting on you to make sure those filthy heathens don’t disrupt our mission."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, if they’re anything like the savages I’ve fought before, it’s nothing I can’t handle."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Right. That’ll be all, Smith, there’s a good man."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"See ya, Percy."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"The men like Smith, don’t they? I’ve never been a popular man."
Pocahontas,Wiggins,I like you.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,And don’t think I don’t know what those backstabbers at court say about me.
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"Oh yes, all that talk about you being a pathetic social climber who’s failed at everything he’s—"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"I’m very well aware that this is my last chance for glory. But mark my words, Wiggins, when King James see the gold these peasants unearth success will be mine, at last."
Pocahontas,Ben,Wake up! Shake a leg!
Pocahontas,Lon,It’s incredible.
Pocahontas,Thomas,And it’s all ours. I’ve never seen anything like it.
Pocahontas,Ben,"It can look like Ratcliffe’s knickers, for all I care, just as long as we get off this stinking boat."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Come on, men, we didn’t come all this way just to look at it."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Keep it taut, lads, keep it taut! Steady, steady."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Ah, that’s far enough! All right now, tie her off."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Here, John, tie up this end. John? John? What are you doing up there?"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Getting a better look. [Meeko bumps into him.] Hey! Well, you’re a strange-looking fellow. You hungry? Here you go, it’s a biscuit. It’s food… Well, sort of. You like it, eh? Well, try eating it for four months straight. You got a friend back there? [Flit attacks him.] Hey, what, what, watch out! No… Get that… Look out!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,John! You better get down here! The Governor’s coming ashore!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"All right, all right, I’m leaving."
Pocahontas,Native American,Did you see their skin? Pale and sickly.
Pocahontas,Native American,They have hair on their faces like dogs.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"My brothers, we must know more about these visitors. Kekata, what do you see?"
Pocahontas,Kekata,"[Chanting.] These are not men like us, but strange beasts with bodies that shine like the sun and weapons that spout fire and thunder. They prowl the earth like ravenous wolves consuming everything in their path."
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Great Powhatan. I will lead our warriors to the river and attack. We will destroy these invaders the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Kocoum, in that battle we knew how to fight our enemy, but these pale visitors are strange to us. Take some men to the river to observe them. Let us hope they do not intend to stay."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"I hereby claim this land and all its riches in the name of His Majesty King James the first, and do so name this settlement Jamestown."
Pocahontas,Englishmen,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"Bravo! Bravo! Beautifully spoken, sir! Hurry now, Percy. We must be all squeaky clean for the New World. [Exits.]"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Captain Smith! It appears I’ve selected the perfect location, eh? Not a savage in sight."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Just because we don’t see them doesn’t mean they’re not out there, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Well then, perhaps you should venture forth and determine their whereabouts, hmm?"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"If there are any Indians out there, I’ll find them."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Now, gentlemen, to work. You men, get the ship unloaded."
Pocahontas,Englishman,"Right, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,You men build the fort. The rest of you… Break out the shovels! It’s time to start digging.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Why, of course! Let’s not forget what the Spanish found when they came to the New World. Gold, mountains of it. Why, for years they’ve been ravaging the New World of its most precious resources but now… It’s our turn."
Pocahontas,Englishmen,Dig and dig and dig and diggety
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Hey nonny nonny
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Ooh, how I love it"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Hey nonny nonny
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Riches for cheap
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Hey nonny nonny
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,There’ll be heaps of it
Pocahontas,Englishmen,Dig and dig and dig and diggety
Pocahontas,John Smith,All of my life I have searched for land like this one
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Keep on working, lads"
Pocahontas,John Smith,Mine
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Don’t be shirking, lads"
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"Dig, dig, and diggety"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Beautiful gold
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"Dig, dig, for that gold"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Make the mounds big, boys"
Pocahontas,John Smith,This land we behold
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,This beauty untold
Pocahontas,John Smith,A man can be bold
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,It all can be sold
Pocahontas,Englishmen,So go for the gold
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Is
Pocahontas,Englishmen,All the riches here
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Mine
Pocahontas,Englishmen,From this minute
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Mine
Pocahontas,Englishmen,This land and what’s in it is
Pocahontas,All,Mine
Pocahontas,Englishmen,Dig and dig and diggety-dig
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, wait! Please! Please! Don’t run off. It’s all right, I’m not gonna hurt you. Here, let me help you out of there."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Mat-ta-que na-to-rath.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You don’t understand a word I’m saying, do you? It’s all right."
Pocahontas,Wind Spirit,Ay ay ay na ay ay na
Pocahontas,John Smith,Who are you?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Pocahontas.
Pocahontas,John Smith,What? What did you say?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,My name is Pocahontas.
Pocahontas,John Smith,I’m John Smith.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"That’s it. Keep at it, men. Keep digging. It’s got to be here somewhere."
Pocahontas,Namontack,"There’s thirty more of them, down by the ridge."
Pocahontas,Kocoum,That makes more than a hundred.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Anything yet?
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Um, how long are we gonna keep digging like this, sir?"
Pocahontas,Ben,"Aye, we’re slaving away, busting our backs, day and night—"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"For king and country, I know, I know, and I share your fatigue. Wiggins! Wiggins!"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Coming!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Dispose of this.
Pocahontas,Wiggins,"[To Percy.] Who’s a good doggy? Who’s a good doggy? Fetch, boy!"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Savages! It’s an ambush, arm yourselves!"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Run!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Arm yourselves! Make sure every man has a musket! Shoot! [Thomas trips over a log and his rifle goes off accidentally, firing right between Ratcliffe's legs.] Them, you idiot! Where’s that blasted Smith when I need him?"
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Namontack!
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Back to the village!
Pocahontas,Englishmen,[Cheer.]
Pocahontas,Ben,"Aye, Governor!"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,[To Thomas.] And you! Learn to use that thing properly. A man’s not a man unless he knows how to shoot.
Pocahontas,Kekata,[Chanting.]
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"These beasts invade our shores, and now this."
Pocahontas,Kekata,[Chanting.] This wound is strange to me.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"We will fight this enemy, but we cannot do it alone. Kocoum, send messengers to every village in our nation. We will call on our brothers to help us fight. [Steps outside the tent.] These White Men are dangerous! No one is to go near them."
Pocahontas,John Smith,It’s called a helmet.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Helmet.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"So, what river is this?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Quiyoughcohannock.
Pocahontas,John Smith,You have most unusual names here. Chicahominy. Quiyough - Quiyoughcohannock. Pocahontas.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"You have the most unusual name, too. John Smith."
Pocahontas,John Smith,[Pulls Meeko out of his bag.] Hey! Is this bottomless pit a friend of yours?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Meeko!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Nothing’s happening.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, no, I need your hand first. It’s how we say hello."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,This is how we say hello. Wingapo.
Pocahontas,John Smith,Wingapo.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,And how we say goodbye. Ana.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"I like hello better. [Flit charges at him.] Yeah, I remember you."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Flit just doesn’t like strangers.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"But I’m not a stranger anymore. Hmm, stubborn little fellow, isn’t he?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Very stubborn.
Pocahontas,John Smith,Hey!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Meeko! Come back here!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Don’t worry, he can’t hurt it. [Meeko hits it against a rock.] Hey, what are you doing?!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Meeko bring that back!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, no, it’s all right. He can keep it. Call it a gift."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What was that?
Pocahontas,John Smith,My compass.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Compass?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"It tells you how to find your way when you get lost. But it’s all right, I’ll get another one in London."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,London? Is that your village?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Yes, it’s a very big village."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What’s it like?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, it’s got streets filled with carriages and bridges over the rivers and buildings as tall as trees."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’d like to see those things.
Pocahontas,John Smith,You will.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,How?
Pocahontas,John Smith,We’re going to build them here. We’ll show your people how to use this land properly. How to make the most of it.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Make the most of it?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Yes, we’ll build roads and decent houses and—"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Our houses are fine.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You think that, only because you don’t know any better. [Pocahontas starts to leave.] Wait a minute, don’t take it that – [Flit attacks him.] Hey, hey, wait! Wait, wait! There’s so much we can teach you. We’ve improved the lives of savages all over the world."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Savages?!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Uh, not that you’re a savage."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Just my people.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, listen, that’s not what I meant. Let me explain—"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Let go!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No, I’m not letting you leave. Look, don’t do this. ‘Savage’ is just a word. You know. A term for… people who are uncivilized."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Like me.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, when I say uncivilized, what I mean is – is…"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"What you mean is, not like you."
Pocahontas,John Smith,What is it?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,The drums. They mean trouble. I shouldn’t be here.
Pocahontas,John Smith,I want to see you again.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I can’t.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Please, don’t leave."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’m sorry. I have to go.
Pocahontas,Ben,All right! This one’s ready to hoist!
Pocahontas,Lon,"Two on each side. Ready now, push! Watch it, it’s slipping!"
Pocahontas,Ben,"Come on, lads, it’s only a little picket fence."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Steady, steady!"
Pocahontas,Ben,There you go!
Pocahontas,Thomas,"That’ll keep everything out, eh, John? Something wrong, John?"
Pocahontas,John Smith,What?
Pocahontas,Thomas,You’ve been awfully quiet the last few days.
Pocahontas,Lon,"Oh, he’s just mad that he missed all the action."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Ah, don’t worry, John. You’ll get your chance to deal with the Indians."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Yeah, we’ll take care of them like that we did last time, eh mates?"
Pocahontas,Ben,"All right, you howling nutter, get to work!"
Pocahontas,Lon,"Come on, Ben. It’s just a little fun."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Oh sure, we’re having loads of fun. Right, look at us. No gold, no food, while Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day happy as a clam."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"I’m doomed! I should be wallowing in riches right now and I haven’t seen so much as a speck! It’s got to be here somewhere. Where could it be? I’ve mined the forests and the hills and swamps, and nothing! Why can’t I find it? What am I overlooking?"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Ah!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,[Gasp.]
Pocahontas,Wiggins,I… I… I made it myself.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Take that silly… Of course, the Indians! Wiggins, why do you think those insolent heathens attacked us?"
Pocahontas,Wiggins,Because we invaded their land and cut down their trees and dug up their earth?
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"It’s the gold! They have it and they don’t want us to take it from them. Well, I’ll just have to take it by force then, won’t I?"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,You there! Where’s Captain Smith?
Pocahontas,Lon,"Well, he’s… gone!"
Pocahontas,Ben,"Aye, your singing must have scared him off."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Well, then go get him, for heaven’s sake!"
Pocahontas,Lon,What if we run into the Indians?
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"That’s what guns are for, now arm yourselves and get moving!"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Pocahontas! You should be inside the village.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,We’ll be all right.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,We’re gathering food for when the warriors arrive.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Don’t go far. Now is not the time to be running off.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Yes, father."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"When I see you wear that necklace, you look just like your mother."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I miss her.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"But she is still with us. Whenever the wind blows through the trees, I feel her presence. Our people looked to her for wisdom and strength. Someday, they will look to you as well."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I would be honored by that.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,You shouldn’t be out here alone. I’ll send for Kocoum. [Exits.]
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What?
Pocahontas,Nakoma,You’re hiding something.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’m not hiding anything.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, you can tell me, I promise I won’t tell anyone —"
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"[Gasp.] Pocahontas, look! It’s one of them! I’m going to get— [Pocahontas covers her mouth.]"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What are you doing here?
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Mmm?!
Pocahontas,John Smith,I had to see you again.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Mmm!
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Mmm!
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Please, don’t say anything. Quick, this way."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,But—
Pocahontas,Kocoum,"Nakoma, where is Pocahontas?"
Pocahontas,Nakoma,I… I haven’t seen her.
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Pocahontas can’t keep running off. It’s dangerous out there. Tell her that. She listens to you.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Huh, sure she does."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"This place is incredible! And to think, we came all this way just to dig it up for gold."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Gold?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Hey, Meeko."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What’s gold?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You know, it’s… It’s yellow, comes out of the ground, it’s really valuable."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Oh, here, we’ve lots of it. [Takes out an ear of corn.] Gold."
Pocahontas,John Smith,No… Gold is this. [Takes out a gold coin.]
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Hmm, there’s nothing like that around here."
Pocahontas,John Smith,No gold?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Not that I’ve seen.
Pocahontas,John Smith,[Laughs.] All this way for nothing. Those boys are in for a big surprise.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Will they leave?
Pocahontas,John Smith,Some of them might.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Will you go home?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Well, it’s not like I have much of a home to go back to. I’ve never really belonged anywhere."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,You could belong here.
Pocahontas,Wind Spirit,Ay ay ay na ay ay na…
Pocahontas,John Smith,What was that?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Did you see something?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"No… No, I just, uh… I… I didn’t see anything. Did I?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Look again.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Let it break upon you
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Pocahontas, the tree is talking to me."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Then you should talk back.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Don’t be frightened, young man. My bark is worse than my bite."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Say something.
Pocahontas,John Smith,What do you say to a tree?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Anything you want.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"So, uh…"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Come closer, John Smith. He has a good soul. And he’s handsome, too."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Oh, I like her."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I knew you would.
Pocahontas,John Smith,We can’t let them see us.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Quick, over here."
Pocahontas,Lon,This place gives me the creeps. Savages could be hiding anywhere.
Pocahontas,Ben,"Aye, well, if you spot one, don’t ask questions. Just shoot."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Watch your feet, you big oaf!"
Pocahontas,Lon,"It wasn’t me, it was the tree."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Oh of course, the tree just felt like lifting its roots and… Let’s get out of here. Run!"
Pocahontas,Lon,But what about Smith?
Pocahontas,Ben,"He’s a big lad, he can take care of himself."
Pocahontas,John Smith,I’m glad you’re on our side.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,There’s still some snap in these old vines.
Pocahontas,John Smith,I better get back before they send the whole camp out after me.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,When will I see you again?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Meet me tonight, right here. [Exits.]"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Well, I haven’t had this much excitement in 200 years."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"What am I doing? I shouldn’t be seeing him again. I mean, I want to see him again—"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Who wouldn’t? I want to see him again.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"But still, something inside is telling me it’s the right thing."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Perhaps it’s your dream.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,My dream? Do you think he’s the one the spinning arrow was pointing to?
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,Mm-hmm!
Pocahontas,Native American,The warriors are here!
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, are you crazy? What were you doing with that—"
Pocahontas,Kocoum,There you are!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Kocoum!
Pocahontas,Kocoum,Look at them. Now we have enough warriors to destroy those white demons!
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Now that we are joined by our brothers, we will defeat this enemy."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Father, I need to speak with you."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Not now, my daughter. The council is gathering."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,We don’t have to fight them! There must be a better way.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,But maybe we should try talking to them.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,They do not want to talk.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"But if one of them did want to talk, you would listen to him, wouldn’t you?"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Pocahontas—
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Wouldn’t you?
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Of course I would. But it is not that simple. Nothing is simple anymore.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Easy, Thomas. It’s me."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Oh, John! I could’ve killed you!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Not aiming like that, you couldn’t. Keep both eyes open when you shoot. You’ll see twice as well."
Pocahontas,Ben,Smith! There ya are!
Pocahontas,Lon,We were looking all over for you.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Smith! Where have you been?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"I was out scouting the terrain, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Excellent. Then you must know the Indians’ whereabouts. We’ll need that information for the battle.
Pocahontas,John Smith,What battle?
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,We will eliminate these savages once and for all.
Pocahontas,John Smith,No! You can’t do that!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Look, we don’t have to fight them."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"John, what’s gotten into you?"
Pocahontas,John Smith,I met one of them.
Pocahontas,Ben,You what?
Pocahontas,Thomas,A savage?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"They’re not savages, they can help us. They know the land, they know how to navigate the rivers. And, look! It’s food!"
Pocahontas,Lon,What is it?
Pocahontas,John Smith,"It’s better than hardtack and gruel, that’s for sure."
Pocahontas,Wiggins,I like gruel.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"They don’t want to feed us, you ninnies! They want to kill us! All of us! They’ve got our gold, and they’ll do anything to keep it!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,But there is no gold!
Pocahontas,Ben,No… gold?
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,And I suppose your little Indian friend told you this.
Pocahontas,John Smith,Yes.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Lies! Lies, all of it! Murderous thieves, there’s no room for their kind in civilized society."
Pocahontas,John Smith,But this is their land!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"This is my land! I make the laws here. And I say anyone so much as looks at an Indian without killing him on sight, will be tried for treason and hanged."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Nakoma!
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Don’t go out there. I lied for you once, don’t ask me to do it again."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I have to do this.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,He’s one of them!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,You don’t know him.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"You go out there, you’ll be turning your back on your own people."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’m trying to help my people.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, please… You’re my best friend, I don’t want you to get hurt."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"I won’t, I know what I’m doing."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, no!"
Pocahontas,Lon,But what if Smith is right? What if there is no gold?
Pocahontas,Englishman,"If you ask me, Ratcliffe’s been lying to us since we left London."
Pocahontas,Ben,"Listen to you, you bunch of idiots. Those savages didn’t attack us for nothing, they’re hiding something."
Pocahontas,Lon,"If they do have the gold, I reckon we’ll have to fight them."
Pocahontas,Thomas,[Gasp.]
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Follow him.
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Yes, Governor."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,I want to know where he’s sneaking off to.
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Yes, sir."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"And if you happen to see any Indians, shoot them. Oh, and Thomas? You’ve been a slipshod sailor and a poor excuse for a soldier. Don’t disappoint me again."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Kocoum?
Pocahontas,Kocoum,What is it?
Pocahontas,Nakoma,It’s Pocahontas.
Pocahontas,Kocoum,What’s wrong? Is she all right?
Pocahontas,Nakoma,I think she’s in trouble.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"The earth is trembling, child. What’s happened?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,The warriors are here!
Pocahontas,John Smith,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,John!
Pocahontas,John Smith,Listen to me. My men are planning to attack your people. You’ve got to warn them.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Maybe it’s not too late to stop this. You have to come with me and talk to my father.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Pocahontas, talking isn’t going to do any good. I already tried talking to my men but everything about this land has them spooked."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,That’s the strangest creature I’ve ever seen!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Percy! Easy, Percy, come here!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Meeko, come back!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You see what I mean? Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Come, come here!"
Pocahontas,John Smith,"It’s all right, he’s a friend. Bad, bad dog! Sit!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,What are you doing? Meeko!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Percy, get back here! Stop that!"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"All right, that’s enough! It’s enough to make your sap boil. Now then, there’s something I want to show you. Look. [Touches a vine to the river surface.]"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,The ripples.
Pocahontas,John Smith,What about them?
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"So small at first, then look how they grow. But someone has to start them."
Pocahontas,John Smith,They’re not going to listen to us.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Young man, sometimes the right path is not the easiest one. Don’t you see, only when the fighting stops can you can be together."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"All right, let’s go talk to your father."
Pocahontas,Kocoum,[War cry.]
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,[Gasp.]
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Kocoum, no! Kocoum! Leave him alone! [Gasps.] Kocoum, stop!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,[Gasp.]
Pocahontas,John Smith,Thomas!
Pocahontas,Thomas,Is he…?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,You killed him!
Pocahontas,Thomas,I thought that—
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Get away from him!
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Pocahontas, it won’t help! He was only—"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,He killed him!
Pocahontas,Native American Warriors,[Shouting.]
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Thomas, get out of here. Get out of here!"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Who did this?
Pocahontas,Native American Warrior,Pocahontas was out in the woods. Kocoum went to find her and this white man attacked them.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Your weapons are strong. But now our anger is stronger. At sunrise he will be the first to die!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,But father!
Pocahontas,Powhatan,I told you to stay in the village. You disobeyed me. You have shamed your father!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I was only trying to help.
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Because of your foolishness, Kocoum is dead! Take him away. [Exits.]"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Kocoum was just coming to protect me.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,"Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you. I was worried about you. I thought I was doing the right thing."
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,All of this happened because of me… And now I’ll never see John Smith again.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Come with me.
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes of the man who killed Kocoum.
Pocahontas,Native American Warrior,Be quick.
Pocahontas,John Smith,Pocahontas!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I’m so sorry.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"For what, this? I’ve gotten out of worse scrapes than this. Can’t think of any right now, but…"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"It would’ve been better if we’d never met, none of this would’ve happened."
Pocahontas,John Smith,"Pocahontas, look at me. I’d rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you."
Pocahontas,Nakoma,Pocahontas?
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I can’t leave you.
Pocahontas,John Smith,"You never will. No matter what happens to me, I’ll always be with you. Forever."
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Help! Somebody, help! Help! Help!"
Pocahontas,Lon,"Easy, lad. What is it?"
Pocahontas,Thomas,It’s Smith! They got him!
Pocahontas,Ben,Who got him?
Pocahontas,Thomas,The savages!
Pocahontas,Englishman,Savages?
Pocahontas,Thomas,"They captured him, dragged him off!"
Pocahontas,Ben,Where’d they take him?
Pocahontas,Thomas,They headed North!
Pocahontas,Lon,How many were there?
Pocahontas,Thomas,"I don’t know, at least a dozen."
Pocahontas,Ben,Filthy beasts!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"It’s perfect, Wiggins! I couldn’t have planned this better myself. The gold is as good as mine!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,We’ve got to save him! He’d do the same for any of us.
Pocahontas,Ben,Thomas is right! We’ve got to do something.
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"And so we shall! I told you those savages couldn’t be trusted. Smith tried to befriend them, and look what they’ve done to him. But now I say it’s time to rescue our courageous comrade. At daybreak, we attack!"
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Barely even human
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,Drive them to our shore
Pocahontas,Englishmen,"They’re savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Kekata,Beneath that milky hide
Pocahontas,Native American Warriors,I wonder if they even bleed
Pocahontas,Native Americans,"They’re savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Barely even human
Pocahontas,Native Americans,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,Killers at the core
Pocahontas,Powhatan,We must sound the drums of war
Pocahontas,Native Americans,"They’re savages, savages"
Pocahontas,All,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Ben,Let’s go get a few men
Pocahontas,All,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Now it’s up to you, men"
Pocahontas,All,"Savages, savages"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"They’re going to kill him at sunrise, Grandmother Willow."
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,You have to stop them.
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I can’t.
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"Child, remember your dream?"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"I was wrong, Grandmother Willow. I followed the wrong path. I feel so lost. [Meeko gives her John’s compass.] The compass? Spinning arrow!"
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,It’s the arrow from your dream!
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I was right! It was pointing to him. [Sunlight hits her face.] Sunrise!
Pocahontas,Grandmother Willow,"It’s not too late, child. Let the spirits of the earth guide you! You know your path, child… Now follow it!"
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,This will be the day
Pocahontas,Powhatan,This will be the morning
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,I don’t know what I can do
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Eagle help my feet to fly
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"Mountain, help my heart be great"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Spirits of the earth and sky
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Please don’t let it be too late
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,How loud are the drums of war
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,Is the death of all I love
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"No! If you kill him you’ll have to kill me, too."
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"Daughter, stand back!"
Pocahontas,Pocahontas,"I won’t! I love him, father. Look around you. This is where the path of hatred has brought us. This is the path I choose, father. What will yours be?"
Pocahontas,Powhatan,"My daughter speaks with wisdom beyond her years. We’ve all come here with anger in our hearts, but she comes with courage and understanding. From this day forward, if there is to be more killing, it will not start with me. Release him."
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Now’s our chance, fire!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,No!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,What?
Pocahontas,Thomas,They let him go!
Pocahontas,Ben,They don’t want to fight!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"It’s a trick, don’t you see? Fire! Fine, I’ll settle this myself."
Pocahontas,John Smith,No! [Jumps in the way.]
Pocahontas,Thomas,John! You shot him!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,He stepped right – right into it! It’s his own fault!
Pocahontas,Ben,Smith was right all along!
Pocahontas,Lon,We never should have listened to you!
Pocahontas,Ben,Get the gun!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,"Traitors! Unhand me, I say, how dare you!"
Pocahontas,Thomas,Put him in chains!
Pocahontas,Ratcliffe,I’ll see you all hanged for this!
Pocahontas,Thomas,And gag him as well.
Pocahontas,Ben,"Is he going to make it, Thomas?"
Pocahontas,Thomas,"Sooner he gets back to England, the better."
Pocahontas,Lon,"Well, let’s hope the wind is with him."
