Aladdin,Jafar,You...are late.
Aladdin,Gazeem,"A thousand apologies, O patient one."
Aladdin,Jafar,"You have it, then?"
Aladdin,Gazeem,"I had to slit a few throats to get it.  (Pulls out half of the medallion.  JAFAR reaches out for it, but GAZEEM yanks it back.)  Ah, ah, ahhh!  The treasure! Ouch!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Trust me, my pungent friend.  You'll get what's coming to you."
Aladdin,Iago,"What's coming to you!  Awk! (JAFAR pulls out the second half of the medallion.  He connects them, and the insect medallion begins to glow.  Finally, it flies out of JAFAR's hand, scaring the horses, and is off towards the dunes.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Quickly, follow the trail! (All ride off, following the glowing speck of light, until it reaches a large dune.  It separates into two and the halves plunge into the dune.  All that remains are two glowing points of light on the dune.  But then the dune begins to rise up, transforming into a giant lion's head, with the glowing points serving as the eyes.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave of wonders!"
Aladdin,Iago,Awk!  Cave of wonders!
Aladdin,Gazeem,By Allah!
Aladdin,Jafar,"Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.  The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine! (GAZEEM starts to approach the lion's mouth, which forms the entrance to the cave.  He chuckles as he goes.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"Awk, the lamp!  Awk,  the lamp!  (Now that IAGO and JAFAR are alone, IAGO opens up in normal English.) Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up? (JAFAR puts his finger to his lips and shushes him.  GAZEEM reaches the cave, but is blown away by the roar of the cave's speaking.)"
Aladdin,Cave,Who disturbs my slumber?
Aladdin,Gazeem,"It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief."
Aladdin,Cave,Know this.  Only one may enter here.  One whose worth lies far within.  A diamond in the rough.
Aladdin,Jafar,"What are you waiting for?  Go on! (GAZEEM hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave.  With great apprehension, he plants his foot down.  Nothing happens. Relieved, he begins his trek again.  Then another roar comes. He turns back, but the lion's mouth slams shut and the dune collapses back to normal.  All that are left are JAFAR, IAGO, and the two separated halves of the medallion.)"
Aladdin,Cave,"Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough."
Aladdin,Iago,I can't believe it.  I just don't believe it. We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp!  Just forget it.  Look at this.  Look at this.  I'm so ticked off that I'm molting!  (He flies up to JAFAR's shoulder.)
Aladdin,Jafar,"Patience, Iago.  Patience.  Gazeem was obviously less than worthy."
Aladdin,Iago,"Oh, there's a big surprise.  That's an incred--I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from not surprise!  What're we gonna do?  We got a big problem here,a big prob-"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Yes, we do.  Only one may enter.  I must find this one, this...diamond in the rough. (Cut to a rooftop, where ALADDIN rushes up to the edge, carrying a loaf of bread.  He almost drops it over the edge.)"
Aladdin,Guard,"Stop, thief!  I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"All this for a loaf of bread? (He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with drying clothes on them.  He skies down them, collecting bits and pieces of clothing on him as he goes.  Finally, he's nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches out and slams the shutters closed.  ALADDIN slams into the shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him.  He pulls off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread when...)"
Aladdin,Guard 1,There he is!
Aladdin,Guard 2,You won't get away so easy!
Aladdin,Aladdin,You think that was easy?
Aladdin,Guard 1,"You two, over that way, and you, with me.  We'll find him. (ALADDIN pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise. He rushes over to the women.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Morning, ladies."
Aladdin,Woman 1,"Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we Aladdin?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Trouble?  No way.  You're only in trouble if you get caught-- (A hand grabs ALADDIN's shoulder and yanks him back.  It's the first GUARD.  ALADDIN's disguise falls off.)
Aladdin,Aladdin,I'm in trouble!
Aladdin,Guard,"...and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU, then the guard's turban is pulled down over his eyes.  ABU dances on the GUARD's head, laughing.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Perfect timing, Abu!"
Aladdin,Abu,Hello!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Come on, let's get outta here! Gotta keep...one jump ahead of the breadline One swing ahead of the sword I steal only what I can't afford That's everything! (ALADDIN battles a GUARD wielding a sword.  He dodges a couple of swings, then pulls down the GUARD's pants.  ABU raspberries the GUARD, then dodges an attack.  The GUARD swings at ALADDIN, but destroys a barrel of fish.  As ALADDIN runs off, the GUARD pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants.) One jump ahead of the lawmen That's all, and that's no joke These guys don't appreciate I'm broke! (ALADDIN and ABU scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down on top of another GUARD.)"
Aladdin,Guards,Riffraff! Street rat! Scoundrel! Take that!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Just a little snack, guys! (ALADDIN scampers to the top of a platform. The GUARDS shake the platform back and fro trying to knock him off.)"
Aladdin,Guards,"Rip him open, take it back guys!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"I can take a hint, gotta face the facts You're my only friend, Abu!"
Aladdin,Women,"Who?!? (ALADDIN jumps off the platform to certain death, only to grab ABU's hands like an acrobat.  The pair swing into a harem.) Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom He's become a one-man rise in crime (ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a chipmunk.)"
Aladdin,Woman,"I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat Tell you all about it when I got the time! (ALADDIN and ABU exit.  Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd.  The GUARDS rush past.  Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind the MUSCLEMAN, matching his moves, until they make a mistake and are discovered.) One jump ahead of the slowpokes One skip ahead of my doom Next time gonna use a nom de plume. One jump ahead of the hitmen One hit ahead of the flock I think I'll take a stroll around the block. (A chase sequence, in which ALADDIN and ABU, pursued by the GUARDS, race through a flock of sheep, hurdle a MAN sleeping on a bed of nails {of course one extremely large GUARD lands on him}.  ABU disguises himself with jewels until a SHOPKEEPER discovers him."
Aladdin,Crowd,"Stop, thief! Vandal! Outrage! Scandal!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Let's not be too hasty (ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens and a large, ugly LADY comes out.)"
Aladdin,Lady,"Still I think he's rather tasty (ALADDIN tumbles away, then puts his arm around a GUARD, acting like they're all chums.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat Otherwise we'd get along!"
Aladdin,Guards,"WRONG! (They all jump into a pile and fight.  When they stop, ALADDIN and ABU are gone.  They are sneaking away in barrels.  They run across a flaming pit, followed by GUARDS who hop up and down, screaming in pain as they cross the rocks.  ALADDIN and ABU pass a SWORD SWALLOWER, then ABU goes back, pulls the sword out of the SWALLOWER's mouth.  ABU advances on the guards, who retreat in fear.)"
Aladdin,Guard 1,He's got a sword!
Aladdin,Guard 2,"You idiot--we've ALL got swords!! (ABU sets the sword down gently, then runs.  ALADDIN and ABU are once again surrounded, with GUARDS coming from left and right. He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street, as the GUARDS all crash into each other.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,One jump ahead of the hoofbeats!
Aladdin,Crowd,Vandal!
Aladdin,Aladdin,One hop ahead of the hump!
Aladdin,Crowd,Street rat!
Aladdin,Aladdin,One trick ahead of disaster
Aladdin,Crowd,Scoundrel!
Aladdin,Aladdin,They're quick--but I'm much faster
Aladdin,Crowd,Take that! (The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room.  He grabs a carpet and jumps out the window)
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Here goes, better throw my hand in Wish me happy landin' All I gotta do is jump! (The GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down to the street, and land in a pile with the sign ""Crazy Hakim's Discount Fertilizer.""  ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely and out of danger. ALADDIN and ABU high-five each other.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right! (ALADDIN breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU, who begins to eat.  But ALADDIN looks over and sees two young children rummaging through the garbage for food.  The GIRL sees him, then drops her find and tries to hide.  ALADDIN looks at them, then the bread, then at ABU.)"
Aladdin,Abu,"Uh-oh! (ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks over to the children.  The GIRL pulls her brother back.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Here, go on--take it. (The children giggle with delight.  ABU tries to swallow his bite, then looks guilty. He walks over to the children and offers his bread to them.  In delight, they pet him on the head.)"
Aladdin,Abu,"Ah, don't.  Huh? (ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade going on.ALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people.  He sees PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse.)"
Aladdin,Bystander 1,"On his way to the palace, I suppose."
Aladdin,Bystander 2,"Another suitor for the princess. (ALADDIN is startled as the two children come running out from the alley. The BOY runs out in front of the PRINCE's horse, startling it.)"
Aladdin,Prince,"Out of my way, you filthy brat! (The PRINCE brings up his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN jumps in front of them and catches the whip.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners"
Aladdin,Prince,Oh--I teach you some manners!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Look at that, Abu.  It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends!"
Aladdin,Prince,"You are a worthless street rat.  You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you. (ALADDIN rushes the PRINCE, but the doors to the castle slam shut in his face.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"I'm not worthless.  And I don't have fleas.  Come on, Abu.  Let's go home. (ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in ABU for the night.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Riffraff, street rat. I don't buy that. If only they'd look closer Would they see a poor boy?  No siree. They'd find out, there's so much more to me. Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.  We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all. (Dissolve to same shot during day.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, missing the rear end of his pants.)"
Aladdin,Prince,I've never been so insulted!
Aladdin,Sultan,"Oh, Prince Achmed.  You're not leaving so soon, are you?"
Aladdin,Prince,Good luck marrying her off!
Aladdin,Sultan,"Oh, Jasmine!  Jasmine!  Jasmine!  (The SULTAN goes off into the garden looking for his daughter.  He finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE's pet tiger, who blocks him off.  RAJAH has a piece of the PRINCE's undershorts in his mouth.The SULTAN grabs the cloth and yanks it out of RAJAH's mouth.) Confound it, Rajah!  So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out!"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, father.  Rajah was just playing with him, weren't you Rajah.  (RAJAH comes over and allows JASMINE to pet and hug him.)  You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you?  (She cuddles with RAJAH, enjoying the moment, until she looks up at her angry father. ) Ahem."
Aladdin,Sultan,"Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor that comes to call.  The law says you..."
Aladdin,Both,...must be married to a prince.
Aladdin,Sultan,By your next birthday.
Aladdin,Jasmine,The law is wrong.
Aladdin,Sultan,You've only got three more days!
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Father,  I hate being forced into this.  (She takes a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry, I want it to be for love."
Aladdin,Sultan,"Jasmine, it's not only this law.  (She hands him the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I'm not going to be around forever, and I just want to make sure you're taken care of, provided for."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Try to understand.  I've never done a thing on my own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the pond, petting the fish.)I've never had any real friends. Except you, Rajah.  (Satisfied, he goes back to sleep.)  I've never even been outside the palace walls."
Aladdin,Sultan,"But Jasmine, you're a princess."
Aladdin,Jasmine,Then maybe I don't want to be a princess.  (She splashes the water.)
Aladdin,Sultan,Oooohhh!  Allah forbid you should have any daughters! (RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second.  JASMINE goes to the dove cage and yanks open the door.  The birds fly off into freedom. She watches them go.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chambers.)
Aladdin,Sultan,"I don't know where she gets it from.  Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.  (A shadow falls over him. He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.)  Ooh, oh. Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor.  I am in desperate need of your wisdom."
Aladdin,Jafar,"My life is but to serve you, my lord."
Aladdin,Sultan,It's this suitor business.  Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.  I'm at my wit's-end.
Aladdin,Iago,Awk!  Wit's-end.
Aladdin,Sultan,"Oh, ha ha.  Have a cracker, pretty polly!  (He pulls a cracker out from his pocket.  IAGO looks terrified.  Then the SULTAN stuffs it in IAGO's mouth.  IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it.  JAFAR and the SULTAN both laugh.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals. Now then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem."
Aladdin,Sultan,"If anyone can help, it's you."
Aladdin,Jafar,"Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond."
Aladdin,Sultan,"Uh, my ring?  But it's been in the family for years."
Aladdin,Jafar,"It is necessary to find the princess a suitor. (JAFAR says the word 'princess' with the accent on the second syllable, ""cess.""  He turns his staff with a cobra head towards the SULTAN.  The eyes of the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR's voice slows down and deepens.  The SULTAN's eyes get a hypnotized look.)  Don't worry.  Everything will be fine."
Aladdin,Sultan,Everything...will be...fine.
Aladdin,Jafar,The diamond.
Aladdin,Sultan,"Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine. (The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"You are most gracious, my liege.  Now run along and play with your little toys."
Aladdin,Sultan,"Yes...that'll be...pretty good. (JAFAR and IAGO exit.  We follow them. When they're out of the room, the parrot spits out the cracker.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"I can't take it anymore!  If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...bam! Whack!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Calm yourself, Iago."
Aladdin,Iago,Then I'd grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack!
Aladdin,Jafar,"Soon, I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit."
Aladdin,Iago,"And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha ha! (The pair pass through a door and slam it shut.  Diss. to ext. gardens at night.  A shadowy figure walks through.  We see it is JASMINE in disguise.  She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it. She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.  I'll miss you.(She begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH, who begins to whine and whimper.)  Good bye! (She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street  ALADDIN and ABU are up to their capers again.  They are on top of the awning of a fruit stand.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Okay, Abu.  Go!"
Aladdin,Proprietor,"Try this, your taste buds will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and hangs there, distracting his attention.)  Hey, get your paws off that."
Aladdin,Abu,Blah blah blah!
Aladdin,Proprietor,"Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape! (He grabs the melon away from ABU.  But in the foreground, ALADDIN dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.)"
Aladdin,Abu,"Bye bye! (He zings back up.  The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front, where he places it on top of a stack.  He looks confused, like he has just done this.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Nice goin' Abu.  Breakfast is served. (ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat.  We see J ASMINE walking through the street.)
Aladdin,Shopkeeper 1,"Pretty lady, buy a pot.  No finer pot in brass or silver."
Aladdin,Shopkeeper 2,"Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs!  Sugar dates and pistachios!"
Aladdin,Shopkeeper 3,"Would the lady like a necklace.  A pretty necklace for a pretty lady. (She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust into her face.)"
Aladdin,Shopkeeper 4,"Fresh fish!  We catch 'em, you buy 'em!"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"I don't think so.  (She backs away, but bumps into a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his fire.)  Oh, excuse me.  (He gulps, then belches fire from his mouth.  JASMINE is disgusted.  He is pleased and taps his stomach.  ALADDIN sees her, and a strange look comes over his face.)  I'm really very sorry."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Wow! (She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head.  ABU sees him and jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's face.)"
Aladdin,Abu,Uh oh.  Hello?  Hello? (JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child reaching for a piece of fruit.  She picks one up and gives it to him.)
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, you must be hungry.  Here you go.  (The boy runs off.)"
Aladdin,Proprietor,You'd better be able to pay for that.
Aladdin,Jasmine,Pay?
Aladdin,Proprietor,No one steals from my cart!
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, I'm sorry sir.  I don't have any money."
Aladdin,Proprietor,Thief!
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan."
Aladdin,Proprietor,"Do you know what the penalty is for stealing? (He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to chop it off.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"No, no please!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found her. I've been looking all over for you.
Aladdin,Jasmine,What are you doing?
Aladdin,Aladdin,Just play along.
Aladdin,Proprietor,You know this girl?
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little crazy.  (He circles his finger around his ear. She is shocked.  The PROPRIETOR grabs him by the vest.)"
Aladdin,Proprietor,She said she knows the Sultan!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"She thinks the monkey is the Sultan. (ABU is picking a pocket.  He hears this, then straightens up. JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you?"
Aladdin,Abu,"Well, blah blah blah blah."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Tragic, isn't it?  (He leans forward, picking up another apple from the cart with his foot.) But, no harm done.  (Walks over to Jasmine.)  Now come along sis. Time to see the doctor."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, hello doctor. How are you?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan. (ABU bows to the crowd and everything he's stolen from the cart falls out.)"
Aladdin,Proprietor,"Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here, you little thieves! (Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab.  IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre contraption.  At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"With all due respect, your rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the SULTAN's ring in the contraption.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"Yes, o mighty evil one. (IAGO runs faster.  A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing into an hourglass below.  The sands begin to swirl.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can enter the cave.  (The sand in top forms the Cave of Wonders.  It falls through into a storm, but it shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) Yes, yes! There he is.  My diamond in the rough!"
Aladdin,Iago,That's him?!?!   That's the clown we've been waitin' for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked into the gears.)
Aladdin,Jafar,"Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?"
Aladdin,Iago,"Swell. (JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with ALADDIN in it.  Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Almost there. (JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms. She stands up.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,I want to thank you for stopping that man.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Uh, forget it.    So, uh, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?"
Aladdin,Jasmine,Is it that obvious?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her, still in love.  She returns the look.  But he realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.) I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned down, she vaults over his head.  He looks back in surprise.  She tosses the pole to him.  Both ALADDIN's and ABU's eyes bulge.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,I'm a fast learner.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Right.  C'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof of a building, dodging planks and beams as they go.)  Whoa.  Watch your head there.  Be careful."
Aladdin,Jasmine,Is this where you live?
Aladdin,Aladdin,Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please.
Aladdin,Jasmine,Fabulous.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and exposes the palace) but it's got a great view. Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, it's wonderful."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"I wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and valets..."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how to dress."
Aladdin,Aladdin,It's better than here.  Always scraping for food and ducking the guards.
Aladdin,Jasmine,You're not free to make your own choices.
Aladdin,Aladdin,Sometimes you feel so--
Aladdin,Jasmine,You're just--
Aladdin,Both,"--trapped. (They look at each other, realizing that they're perfect for one another.  But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the look.  He takesthe apple out of ABU's hand and rolls it down his arm into the hand of JASMINE.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"So, where're you from?"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not going back."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted look on his face.)"
Aladdin,Abu,Why you!
Aladdin,Jasmine,My father's forcing me to get married.
Aladdin,Aladdin,That's--that's awful.  (ABU appears from behind the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!
Aladdin,Jasmine,What?
Aladdin,Aladdin,Abu says that--uh--that's not fair.
Aladdin,Abu,What?
Aladdin,Jasmine,Oh did he?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Yeah, of course."
Aladdin,Jasmine,And does Abu have anything else to say?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help."
Aladdin,Abu,"Oh, boy!"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Hmm, tell him that's very sweet. (ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until ALADDIN leans in to kiss her.  He is interrupted, however, by the GUARDS, who have found them.)"
Aladdin,Guard,Here you are!
Aladdin,Aladdin And Jasmine,They've found me!   They're after you?
Aladdin,Jasmine,My father must have sent them--
Aladdin,Aladdin,Do you trust me?
Aladdin,Jasmine,What?
Aladdin,Aladdin,Do you trust me?
Aladdin,Jasmine,Yes.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Then jump! (They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt.  They try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)"
Aladdin,Guard,"We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat? (Again, the GUARD's turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are here and block the exit.  The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and throws him in a vase.  Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)"
Aladdin,Guard,"It's the dungeon for you, boy."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Hey, get off of me!"
Aladdin,Jasmine,Let go of him.
Aladdin,Guard,"Look what we have here, men--a street mouse.  (He throws her down.)"
Aladdin,Guard,Princess Jasmine.
Aladdin,Aladdin,The princess?
Aladdin,Abu,The princess?
Aladdin,Guard,What are you doing outside the palace?  And with this street rat?
Aladdin,Jasmine,That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release him!
Aladdin,Guard,"Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from Jafar.  You'll have to take it up with him."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Believe me, I will. (Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers.  He slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming in before he is finished.  He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside the door frame.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,Jafar?
Aladdin,Jafar,"Oh, uh, princess."
Aladdin,Iago,"Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his cape, hiding the door.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders."
Aladdin,Jafar,Your father's charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah.  The boy was a criminal.
Aladdin,Jasmine,What was the crime?
Aladdin,Iago,"I can't breathe, Jafar!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Why, kidnapping the princess, of course."
Aladdin,Iago,"If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt!"
Aladdin,Jasmine,He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!
Aladdin,Jafar,"Oh, dear!  Oh, why frightfully upsetting.  Had I but known."
Aladdin,Jasmine,What do you mean?
Aladdin,Jafar,"Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out."
Aladdin,Jasmine,What sentence?
Aladdin,Jafar,Death. By beheading.
Aladdin,Jasmine,No!
Aladdin,Jafar,"I am exceedingly sorry, princess."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"How could you? (IAGO finally makes it out through the door.  He flies up and lands on JAFAR's shoulder, coughing.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"So, how did  it go?"
Aladdin,Jafar,"I think she took it rather well.  (They both get a sinister smile on their faces.) (Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain.  RAJAH comes over to comfort her.  She pets him.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"It's all my fault, Rajah.  I didn't even know his name. (Cut to int. of dungeon.  Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see ALADDIN chained to the wall.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,She was the princess.  I don't believe it.  I must have sounded so stupid to her.
Aladdin,Abu,Yoo-hoo!  Aladdin? Hello!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Abu!  Down here!  Hey, c'mon--help me outta these. (ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground.  He wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an imitation of the princess.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Hey, she was in trouble.  Ah, she was worth it. (ABU jumps up on ALADDIN's shoulders and pulls a small set of tools out of his pocket, then frees ALADDIN.)"
Aladdin,Abu,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.  I'm a street rat, remember, and there's a law. She's gotta marry a prince, she deserves it."
Aladdin,Abu,Ta da!
Aladdin,Aladdin,I'm a--I'm a fool
Aladdin,Old Man,"You're only a fool if you give up, boy. (We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU have seen before.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Who are you?
Aladdin,Old Man,"A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together, perhaps we can be more."
Aladdin,Aladdin,I'm listening.
Aladdin,Old Man,"There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager. (Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word 'princess' as ""prin-CESS"" rather than the standard pronunciation of ""PRIN-cess.""   The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks his head out of JAFAR's ""old man"" disguise.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I'm dyin' in here!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,But the law says that only a prince can marry--
Aladdin,Old Man,"You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy? Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(He grins, showing a hideously bad mouth.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,So why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?
Aladdin,Old Man,I need a young man with strong legs and a strong back to go in after it.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here?"
Aladdin,Old Man,"Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren't always what they seem.  So, do we have a deal?"
Aladdin,Abu,"Oh, hmm. (Cut to desert scene.  We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the OLD MAN and ABU on it.  Diss. to cave of wonders.)"
Aladdin,Cave,Who disturbs my slumber?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"It is I, Aladdin."
Aladdin,Cave,"Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp. (The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of ALADDIN. )"
Aladdin,Old Man,"Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, and then you shall have your reward."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"C'mon, Abu.  (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of his vest.) (ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase.  He reaches the bottom and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Would ya look at that!
Aladdin,Abu,Uh oh!
Aladdin,Aladdin,Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan!
Aladdin,Aladdin,Abu!
Aladdin,Aladdin,Don't...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp. (They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises off the floor and begins following them.  ABU gets the feeling they're being followed.)
Aladdin,Abu,"Huh? (He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and the CARPET begins to follow again.  Again, ABU turns back, but the CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.)"
Aladdin,Abu,Aladdin!  Aladdin!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Abu, will ya knock it off? (Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet jumps to the other side.  It reaches down with a tassel and pulls ABU's tail.  When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other side.  This time, ABU lands in a karate stance.  CARPET reaches down and plucks ABU's hat off, then puts it on himself.  ABU sits thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his face.  ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away.  ABU tackles ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Abu, what are you--crazy?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.  I'm not gonna hurt you. (The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts it off.  It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to him.  ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulder.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite. (The CARPET again picks up ABU's hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes his fist and screeches at it.  CARPET begins to walk away, ""sadly."")"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Maybe you can help us.  (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies over and wraps around the pair.)  Hey, whoa!  You see, we're trying to find this lamp.  (CARPET motions for them to follow it.)  I think he knows where it is. (They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant underground cavern.  In the centre of the room is a tall pillar, with a staircase going up to it.  It is surrounded by water with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge.  At the top of the pillar is a beam of light.  ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Wait here!
Aladdin,Abu,Oh.  Huh? (ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a giant ruby.  ABU is hypnotically drawn to it.   ALADDIN climbs the stairs quickly.  CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)
Aladdin,Aladdin,This is it?  This is what we came all the way down here to--  (He looks down and sees ABU break free of CARPET's hold and lunge toward the jewel.)  Abu- NO! (ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to shake.)
Aladdin,Cave Voice,Infidels!
Aladdin,Abu,Uh oh!
Aladdin,Cave Voice,"You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you will never again see the light of day! (ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock is exploding.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Whoa!  Carpet, let's move! (Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off his head and sees they are flying into a wall.) Start panicking. (CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top, within reach.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Help me out!
Aladdin,Old Man,Throw me the lamp!
Aladdin,Aladdin,I can't hold on.  Give me your hand.
Aladdin,Old Man,"First give me the lamp! (ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)"
Aladdin,Old Man,Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha! (ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)
Aladdin,Aladdin,What are you doing?
Aladdin,Old Man,"Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his normal voice.) Your eternal reward. (He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off his disguise.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't find it in his pocket)--- where is it?  No. NO!! (Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,"Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong?"
Aladdin,Jasmine,Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She looks as if she's been crying.)
Aladdin,Sultan,"There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right. Now, tell me everything. (Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET. ABU tries to wake him.)"
Aladdin,Abu,"Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Oh, my head. We're trapped.  (Angry, shaking his fists at the entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal! Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp."
Aladdin,Abu,Aha!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.  Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out. (He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya such a crick in the neck!  (He hangs ALADDIN on a nearby rock.  Then he pulls his head off and spins it around, yelling as he does so.  CARPET pulls a ALADDIN down.)  Whoa!  Does it feel good to be outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.  Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in ALADDIN's face.)  What's your name?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin."
Aladdin,Genie,"(Says his name as if he's discovered something major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with ALADDIN's name on it, circled by chase lights.  The sign changes to reflect the GENIE's upcoming line.) Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.  Can we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?'  Or how bout 'Laddi?'  (GENIE disappears, then a dog wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like 'Here, boy! C'mon, Laddi!'"
Aladdin,Aladdin,I must have hit my head harder than I thought.
Aladdin,Genie,"Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I didn't singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven't seen you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo! Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE. GENIE looks at ALADDIN.)  Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master.   Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.  Look at me from the side--do I look different to you?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Wait a minute!  I'm--your master?
Aladdin,Genie,"(Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a mortarboard on his head.)  That's right!  He can be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with a dummy) often imitated, but never duplicated-- DUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated."
Aladdin,Aladdin,Whoa!  Wish fulfillment?
Aladdin,Genie,"Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes.  (Turns into a slot machine, arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in the windows.)  That's it--three.  (Three GENIE caballeros come out of the slot.)  Uno, dos, tres. No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck drops with the secret word ""Refunds.'"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Now I know I'm dreaming.
Aladdin,Genie,"Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here! So why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a fluorescent light) Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves Scheherazadie had a thousand tales But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeve You got a brand of magic never fails! (GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes the thieves into submission.) You got some power in your corner now Some heavy ammunition in your camp You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how See all you gotta do is rub that lamp And I'll say (Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's hand and rubs lamp with it.) Mister Aladdin sir What will your pleasure be? Let me take your order, jot it down You ain't never had a friend like me No no no! (GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a note pad, like a waiter. ) Life is your restaurant And I'm your maitre' d! C'mon whisper what it is you want You ain't never had a friend like me. (GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes into four duplicate GENIEs.) Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service You're the boss, the king, the shah! Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish How about a little more Baklava? (The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfy chair   surrounded by the treasure and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the screen with baklava.) Try some of column 'A' Try all of column 'B' I'm in the mood to help you dude You ain't never had a friend like me (ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top, then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth, and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE dressed like a magician comes out.) (The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish him into nothing.) Can your friends do this? Do your friends do that? Do your friends pull this out their little hat Can your friends go poof! Well looky here Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip And then make the sucker disappear? (The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them. He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon . The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS, who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them, they disappear.) So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed I'm here to answer all your midday prayers You got me bona fide, certified You got a genie for a charg? d'affairs! I got a powerful urge to help you out So what you wish I really want to know You got a wish that's three miles long, no doubt So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh! (GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.) Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three I'm on the job, you big nabob You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend You ain't never...had a... friend... like...me! You ain't never had a friend like me! (The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one. She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels, and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a neon ""APPLAUSE"" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that is is empty.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"So what'll it be, master?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want?
Aladdin,Genie,"Ah, almost.  There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Like?
Aladdin,Genie,"Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody.  (He slices his head off with his finger.)  So don't ask.  Rule two: I can't make anyone fall in love with anyone else.  (Head turns into a big pair of lips which kiss ALADDIN.)  You little punim, there. (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a zombie.) Rule three: I can't bring people back from the dead.  It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing it!  (He poofs back to normal.)  Other than that, you got it!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Ah, provisos?  You mean limitations?  On wishes?  Some all powerful genie--can't even bring people back from the dead. I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even get us out of this cave.  Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here-- (They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of them.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Excuse me?  Are you lookin' at me?  Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did you bring me here?  And all of a sudden, you're walkin' out on me?   I don't think so, not right now.  You're gettin' your wishes, so siddown!  (They all get on CARPET. GENIE takes the form of a stewardess, with lots of arms pointing out the exits.)  In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here,here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, anywhere!  Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet.  Weeee'rrrrrreee...outta here! (The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off into the distance.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. JAFAR is there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,"Jafar, this is an outrage.  If it weren't for all your years of loyal service... . From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded."
Aladdin,Jafar,"I assure you, your highness, it won't happen again."
Aladdin,Sultan,"Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy business behind us.  Please?"
Aladdin,Jafar,"My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, princess.  (He takes her hand to kiss it, but she yanks it away.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"At least some good will come of my being forced to marry.  When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you."
Aladdin,Sultan,"That's nice.  All settled, then.  Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business, (he looks and sees Jasmine walking out) Jasmine? Jasmine!"
Aladdin,Jafar,If only I had gotten that lamp!
Aladdin,Iago,"I will have the power to get rid of you!  D'oh!  To think--we gotta keep kissing up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives..."
Aladdin,Jafar,"No, Iago.  Only until she finds a chump husband. Then she'll have us banished--or beheaded!"
Aladdin,Both,Eeewww!
Aladdin,Iago,Oh!  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute! Jafar?  What if you were the chump husband?
Aladdin,Jafar,What?
Aladdin,Iago,"Okay, you marry the princess,all right? Then, uh, you become sultan!"
Aladdin,Jafar,Oh!Marry the shrew?  I become sultan.  The idea has merit!
Aladdin,Iago,"Yes, merit! Yes!  And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff!  (Dive bombs into the floor)  Kersplat!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works! (Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is coming in for a landing.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs.  Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop.  (As ALADDIN and ABU get off down the stairway formed by CARPET) Thank you.  Good bye, good bye!  Thank you! Good bye!    Well, now.  How about that, Mr.  doubting mustafa?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Oh, you sure showed me.  Now about my three wishes-"
Aladdin,Genie,"Dost mine ears deceive me?  Three? You are down by ONE, boy!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the cave.  You did that on your own. (GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops.  He turns into a sheep.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Well, don't I feel just sheepish?  All right, you baaaaad boy,  but no more freebies."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Fair deal.  So, three wishes.  I want them to be good.   What would you wish for?"
Aladdin,Genie,"Me?  No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in my case, ah, forget it."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"What?  No, tell me."
Aladdin,Genie,Freedom.
Aladdin,Aladdin,You're a prisoner?
Aladdin,Genie,"It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig. Phenomenal cosmic powers! Itty bitty living space"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Genie, that's terrible."
Aladdin,Genie,"But, oh--to be free.  Not have to go ""Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?""  To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and smell the hummus"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Why not?
Aladdin,Genie,The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's happened.
Aladdin,Aladdin,I'll do it. I'll set you free.
Aladdin,Genie,"Uh huh, right.  Whoop!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free."
Aladdin,Genie,"Well, here's hopin'. O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want most?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Well, there's this girl--"
Aladdin,Genie,"Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't make anybody fall in love, remember?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and..."
Aladdin,Genie,Pretty?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and this hair, wow...and her smile."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince?"
Aladdin,Genie,"Let's see here.   Uh, chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab? (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from ""The Little Mermaid""  clamped on.)  Ow, I hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu, Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the words!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!"
Aladdin,Genie,"All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century. These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No! Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and he flies over.)"
Aladdin,Abu,Uh oh!
Aladdin,Genie,"Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with ""AL"" on it.)  And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out, it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.) Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need? (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning"
Aladdin,Abu Into,"a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac, with license plate ""ABU 1.""   (That one's a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!! (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk space, check this action out! (ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree. The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Abu, you look good."
Aladdin,Genie,"He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but we're not through yet.  Hang on to your turban, kid, cause we're gonna make you a star! (We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys. We tilt up and see the SULTAN balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top, then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the pile collapses.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with your daughter."
Aladdin,Iago,Awk!  The problem with your daughter!
Aladdin,Sultan,"Oh, really?"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Right here.  ""If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her."""
Aladdin,Sultan,"But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to stuff a cracker into IAGO's mouth.  IAGO backs away.  The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker back.)  How could I choose someone she hates? (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess must then be wed to...hmm...interesting."
Aladdin,Sultan,What?  Who?
Aladdin,Jafar,"The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me!"
Aladdin,Sultan,"Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess, I'm quite sure."
Aladdin,Jafar,"Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the SULTAN with it.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,Yes...desperate measures...
Aladdin,Jafar,You will order the princess to marry me.
Aladdin,Sultan,I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell breaks momentarily)...but you're so old!
Aladdin,Jafar,The princess will marry me!
Aladdin,Sultan,"The princess will marry...(the spell is again broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of ""Prince Ali"".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha. Jafar., you must come and see this! (We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in human form as a MAJOR.)"
Aladdin,Marchers,Make way for Prince Ali!
Aladdin,Swordsmen,Say hey!  It's Prince Ali!
Aladdin,Major,"Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar, Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star, Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye! Make way, here he comes, Ring bells, bang the drums. You're gonna love this guy Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa! Genuflect, show some respect Down on one knee on his back.) Now try your best to stay calm Brush up your Sunday Salaam And come and meet his spectacular coterie. (IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The MAJOR ""wheelbarrows"" six men up onto ABU's trunk.  They stand on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.) Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa! Strong as ten regular men, definitely He faced the galloping hordes A hundred bad guys with swords Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali! brand lightning bolt zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.)"
Aladdin,Chorus Of Men,He's got seventy-five golden camels!
Aladdin,Harry,"Don't they look lovely, June?"
Aladdin,Chorus Of Women,"Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three!"
Aladdin,June,"Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers!"
Aladdin,Genie,"(GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down the parade) When it comes to exotic type mammals Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you It's a world class menagerie! (GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)"
Aladdin,Chorus,"He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys! And to view them, he charges no fee! He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies! They bow to his whim, love serving him They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali! (ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door. Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Prince Ali! Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see! And that,good people, is why He got dolled up and dropped by With sixty elephants, llamas galore With his bears and lions A brass band and more With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers His birds that warble on key Make way for Prince Ali! (More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the door shut.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,"Splendid, absolutely marvelous."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Ahem.  Your majesty, I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand."
Aladdin,Sultan,"Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to meet you. This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He's delighted too."
Aladdin,Jafar,"Ecstatic.  I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo--"
Aladdin,Aladdin,--Ababwa!
Aladdin,Jafar,Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to--
Aladdin,Sultan,"...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device. (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his moustache.)  I don't suppose I might..."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me. (He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down. JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Sire, I must advise against this--"
Aladdin,Sultan,"--Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun. (He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack, flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,Just where did you say you were from?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure."
Aladdin,Jafar,Try me.
Aladdin,Sultan,"Look out, Polly! (They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug! (The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying ""Have a cracker, have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,"Out of the way, I'm coming in to land.  Jafar, watch this!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Spectacular, your highness."
Aladdin,Sultan,"Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.  (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then collapses.  ABU catches it.)  This is a very impressive youth. And a prince as well.   (Whispers to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all."
Aladdin,Jafar,"I don't trust him, sire."
Aladdin,Sultan,"Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I'm an excellent judge of character."
Aladdin,Iago,"Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...not!!!"
Aladdin,Sultan,Jasmine will like this one!
Aladdin,Aladdin,And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine!
Aladdin,Jafar,"Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.   This boy is no different than the others.  What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks JAFAR's goatee, which springs out in all directions.)  Just let her meet me.  I will win your daughter!"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"How dare you! All of you, standing around deciding my future?  I am not a prize to be won!"
Aladdin,Sultan,"Oh, dear.  Don't worry, Prince Ali.  Just give Jasmine time to cool down."
Aladdin,Jafar,I think it's time to say good bye to Prince Abooboo. (Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)
Aladdin,Aladdin,"What am I going to do?  Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.  I should have known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.  (ABU struggles with his elephant paws to open a banana.  He squishes it, and the banana squirts into his eye.  He then tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the same.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"So move!  (CARPET does, knocking a black piece off the board.)  Hey. That's a good move.   I can't believe it--I'm losing to a rug."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Genie, I need help."
Aladdin,Genie,"All right, sparky, here's the deal.  You wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter, do ya follow me?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,What?
Aladdin,Genie,"(Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points out his words on a blackboard)  Tell her the...TRUTH!!!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"No way!  If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me. (He puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh! (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light. GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay, I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.  How do I look?"
Aladdin,Genie,"Like a prince. (ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed, sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Princess Jasmine?
Aladdin,Jasmine,Who's there?
Aladdin,Aladdin,It's me--Prince Ali.  Ahem--(Then he jumps to his deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.
Aladdin,Jasmine,I do not want to see you.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"No, no, please princess.  Give me a chance. (RAJAH growls and advances on him.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,Just leave me alone.
Aladdin,Aladdin,Down kitty!
Aladdin,Genie,How's our beau doing?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off his turban to brush RAJAH away.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"(She looks at him thinking she has seen him before.)  Wait, wait.  Do I know you?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Uh, no, no."
Aladdin,Jasmine,You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"The marketplace? I have servants that go to the marketplace for me. Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"No, I guess not."
Aladdin,Bee,"Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk about her! She's smart,  fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything--pick a feature!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very..."
Aladdin,Bee,"Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Punctual!
Aladdin,Jasmine,Punctual?
Aladdin,Bee,Sorry.
Aladdin,Aladdin,Beautiful.
Aladdin,Bee,Nice recovery.
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Hmm.  I'm rich too, you know."
Aladdin,Aladdin,Yeah!
Aladdin,Jasmine,The daughter of a sultan
Aladdin,Aladdin,I know.
Aladdin,Jasmine,A fine prize for any  prince to marry.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me."
Aladdin,Bee,Warning! Warning!
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt, swaggering, peacock I've met!"
Aladdin,Bee,Mayday! Mayday!
Aladdin,Jasmine,Just go jump off a balcony!
Aladdin,Aladdin,What?
Aladdin,Bee,Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?
Aladdin,Aladdin,Buzz off!
Aladdin,Bee,"Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into his turban)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Yeah, right!"
Aladdin,Jasmine,What!?!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Uh, you're right.  You aren't just some prize to be won.    You should be free to make your own choice.  (JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.)  I'll go now. (He steps up on the ledge and drops off.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,No!
Aladdin,Aladdin,What?  What?
Aladdin,Jasmine,How--how are you doing that?
Aladdin,Aladdin,It's a magic carpet.
Aladdin,Jasmine,It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a tassel.)
Aladdin,Aladdin,"You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world."
Aladdin,Jasmine,Is it safe?
Aladdin,Aladdin,Sure.  Do you trust me?
Aladdin,Jasmine,(She looks at him at the saying of that all- important line) What?
Aladdin,Aladdin,Do you trust me?
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Yes. (She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky, knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of ""A Whole New World"" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me princess, now when did you last Let your heart decide? (CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. She smiles.) I can open your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways, and under On a magic carpet ride A whole new world! A new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no Or where to go Or say we're only dreaming (JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET flies in and out of the clouds.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,A whole new world A dazzling place I never knew But when I'm way up here It's crystal clear That now I'm in a whole new world with you!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Now I'm in a whole new world with you! (They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Unbelievable sights Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an endless diamond sky (They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,A whole new world!
Aladdin,Aladdin,Don't you dare close your eyes
Aladdin,Jasmine,An hundred thousand things to see
Aladdin,Aladdin,Hold your breath--it gets better!
Aladdin,Jasmine,"I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far I can't go back to where I used to be! (They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,A whole new world!
Aladdin,Jasmine,Every turn a surprise
Aladdin,Aladdin,With new horizons to pursue
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Every moment, red-letter"
Aladdin,Both,"I'll chase them anywhere There's time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world That's where we'll be (They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,A thrilling chase
Aladdin,Jasmine,A wondrous place
Aladdin,Both,"For you and me! (CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,It's all so magical.
Aladdin,Aladdin,Yeah.
Aladdin,Aladdin,Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up realizing what is happening.)  He doesn't really like flying either. That is...oh no!
Aladdin,Jasmine,You are the boy from the market!  I knew it.  Why did you lie to me?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Jasmine, I'm sorry."
Aladdin,Jasmine,Did you think I was stupid?
Aladdin,Aladdin,No!
Aladdin,Jasmine,That I wouldn't figure it out?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.  No, that's not what I meant."
Aladdin,Jasmine,Who are you?  Tell me the truth!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on, giving up hope.)  The truth...the truth is...I sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life.  (CARPET slumps down in defeat.)  But I really am a prince! (The feather on his turban falls down over his eyes.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,Why didn't you just tell me?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think?"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Not that strange. (She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a tassel under his ""chin"" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext. of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends just below the balcony.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Good night, my handsome prince."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Sleep well, princess. (They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends to the ground.) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right."
Aladdin,Aladdin,Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth. Muffled words) Abu!  Abu!  (We see the elephant hanging from a net tied in a tree.)
Aladdin,Guard,Hold him! (Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties CARPET in a knot around a tree.)
Aladdin,Jafar,"I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo.    Make sure he's never found. (A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water. He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes, and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Never fails.  Get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp.    Hello.  (Sees unconscious ALADDIN) Al?  Al!  Kid, snap out of it! You can't cheat on this one!  I can't help you unless you make a wish.  You have to say  ""Genie I want you to save my life.""  Got it?  Okay.  C'mon Aladdin!!  (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and shakes him.  His head goes up, then falls.)  I'll take that as a yes. Wooga!  Wooga!    Up scope!  (He babbles in something that sounds like German.  On the surface, a giant water spout emerges, and lands on top of the cliff.  ALADDIN reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs.) Don't you scare me like that!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(He can't think of how to say it, so they just hug each other.)  Thanks, Genie."
Aladdin,Genie,"Oh, Al.  I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.  Not that I want to pick out curtains or anything. (Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming ""A Whole New World"" and brushing her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,Jasmine!
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time. I'm so happy."
Aladdin,Sultan,"You should be, Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you."
Aladdin,Jasmine,What?
Aladdin,Sultan,You will wed Jafar.
Aladdin,Jafar,"You're speechless, I see.  A fine quality in a wife."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"I will never marry you. Father, I choose Prince Ali!"
Aladdin,Jafar,Prince Ali left!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar!"
Aladdin,Jasmine,Prince Ali!
Aladdin,Iago,"How in the he----uh, awk!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Tell them the truth, Jafar!  You tried to have me killed."
Aladdin,Jafar,"What?    Ridiculous nonsense, your highness.  He is obviously lying."
Aladdin,Sultan,Obviously...lying.
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Father, what's wrong with you?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,I know! (ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches and the spell is broken for good.)
Aladdin,Sultan,"Oh, oh, oh my!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this!"
Aladdin,Sultan,"What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Your majesty, all of this can be explained."
Aladdin,Sultan,Guards! Guards!
Aladdin,Iago,"Well, that's it--we're dead, forget about it.  Just dig a grave for both of us.  We're dead. (But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,Arrest Jafar at once.
Aladdin,Jafar,"This is not done yet, boy! (JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,"Find him, search everywhere!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Jasmine, are you all right?"
Aladdin,Jasmine,Yes.
Aladdin,Sultan,"Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time.  Just horrible.  How will I ever- Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?  Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once! Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Sultan?
Aladdin,Sultan,"Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks concerned at this.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get--  I gotta start packing, your highness.  Only essentials. (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage. JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a weird face in it. Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar? Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around the neck) Good grip!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago."
Aladdin,Iago,Why that miserable--
Aladdin,Jafar,But you are going to relieve him of it!
Aladdin,Iago,Me?
Aladdin,Aladdin,Sultan?  They want me to be sultan?
Aladdin,Genie,"Huzzah!  Hail the conquering hero!  (Turns into a one-man band.  He sees ALADDIN walk away with his head hung.  He stops, scratches his head, comes up with an idea, then zooms over to ALADDIN.  He holds up his hands like a director scoping a picture and we look through them.)  Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess.  What are you gonna do next?  (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away in sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs. GENIE again is confused, then goes to him and pulls out a script labeled ""Aladdin."" Whispering: ) Psst, your line is ""I'm going to free the genie."" Anytime."
Aladdin,Aladdin,Genie...I can't.
Aladdin,Genie,"Sure you can.  You just go ""Genie, I wish you free.""  (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses him as a mock ventriloquist's dummy.  ALADDIN pulls away.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"I'm serious.  Look, I'm sorry--I really am. But they want to make me sultan--no!, They want to make Prince Ali sultan.  Without you, I'm just Aladdin."
Aladdin,Genie,"Al, you won!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Because of you!  The only reason anyone thinks I'm anything is because of you.  What if they find out I'm not really a prince?    What if Jasmine finds out?  I'll lose her.  Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.  I can't wish you free."
Aladdin,Genie,"Hey, I understand.  After all, you've lied to everyone else.  Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.  Now, if you'll excuse me, master. (He says the last word in disgust, then poofs back into the lamp.)"
Aladdin,Abu,Ohhh.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Genie, I'm really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the spout and raspberries him.)   Well, fine. (He slams a pillow on top of the LAMP.)  Then just stay in there!    What are you guys looking at?  Look, I--I'm sorry.  Wait, Abu-- wait--I'm sorry, I didn't-- wait, c'mon.    What am I doing? Genie's right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Well, here goes.  (He walks into the garden.)  Jasmine?  Where are you? (We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"I'm coming. (We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs, then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is panting.)"
Aladdin,Flamingo,D'uh!
Aladdin,Iago,"Ya got a problem, pinky?  (He sweeps the bird's feet out from under it. IAGO runs into the palace and finds the lamp under the pillow.)  Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you!  (Stretches his face like JAFAR's and imitates it.)  Good work, Iago! Ah, go on.   No, really--on a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven!  Ah, Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm blushing. (Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making an announcement to the people.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,"People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a suitor! (Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Jasmine?
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Ali, where have you been?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,There's something I've got to tell you.
Aladdin,Jasmine,The whole kingdom has turned out for father's announcement!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Good luck!  (She pushes him out onto the platform with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire crowd.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,...Ali Ababwa!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Oh, boy!"
Aladdin,Iago,"Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak."
Aladdin,Jafar,Let them cheer.
Aladdin,Genie,"You know Al, I'm getting reallyyyyyy--I don't think you're him.  (He descends and consults a playbill.)  Tonight, the role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man."
Aladdin,Jafar,I am your master now.  (He throws GENIE to the ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.)
Aladdin,Genie,I was afraid of that.
Aladdin,Jafar,"Genie, grant me my first wish.  I wish to rule on high, as sultan!!! (Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes. The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Whoa!
Aladdin,Sultan,"Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on? (His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,Heh heh heh!
Aladdin,Sultan,"Jafar, you vile betrayer."
Aladdin,Iago,That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Oh, yeah?  Well, we'll just see about that!  (Pulls off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Finders-keepers, Abooboo. (They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him. They fly up near the GENIE's head.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Genie!  No!
Aladdin,Genie,"Sorry, kid--I got a new master now.  (He places the palace on top of a mountain.)"
Aladdin,Sultan,"Jafar, I order you to stop!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"There's a new order now--my order!  Finally, you will bow to me!"
Aladdin,Jafar,We'll never bow to you!
Aladdin,Iago,Why am I not surprised?
Aladdin,Jafar,"If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer!    Genie, my second wish--I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world! (GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot, and another GENIE  brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR, returning him to his normal look.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Now where were we?  Ah, yes--abject humiliation! (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him. He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty- cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to introduce you to."
Aladdin,Aladdin,Jafar!  Get your hands off her!
Aladdin,Jafar,"Prince Ali Yes, it is he, But not as you know him. Read my lips and come to grips With reality Yes, meet a blast from your past Whose lies were too good to last Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!"
Aladdin,Iago,Or should we say Aladdin?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Jasmine, I tried to tell you."
Aladdin,Jafar,"So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin Just a con, need I go on? Take it from me His personality flaws Give me adequate cause To send him packing on a one-way trip So his prospects take a terminal dip His assets frozen, the venue chosen Is the ends of the earth, whoopee! So long,"
Aladdin,Iago,"Good bye, see ya!"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Ex-Prince Ali! (JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop. ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Abu?  Abu!  (He looks back at a shivering pile of snow.)  Oh, this is all my fault--I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.  (He digs out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.)  Abu! Are you okay?  I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of everything, somehow.  I gotta go back and set things right.  (He starts to walk through the snow, and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET.) Carpet!  (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by the pillar.  He tugs to try and free CARPET.  He can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the base of the pillar.)   Abu, start digging!  That's it!  (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and the pillar begins to roll.  ALADDIN runs away, looks back, then slides into place.  The pillar rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by the window of the pillar.)  Yeah!  All right!  (He looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU. CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick them up.)  Now, back to Agrabah!  Let's go! (We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.)"
Aladdin,Iago,"Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker. Shove 'em all right down your throat.  Here, have lots!"
Aladdin,Jafar,Leave him alone!
Aladdin,Jafar,"It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. What do you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen..."
Aladdin,Jasmine,Never!
Aladdin,Jafar,"I'll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he raises his hand to slap her.  Then he stops.)  No. Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.  I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me."
Aladdin,Genie,"Ah, master-- there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo-"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Don't talk back to me, you stupid blue lout!  You will do what I order you to do, slave! (JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to play along.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"That's better.  (He pulls the GENIE's jaw up like a shade.)  Now, pussycat, tell me more about...myself."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"You're tall, well dressed... (JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE sees them.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Al!  Al, little buddy!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Shh!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Hey--I'm a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE's mouth.)  I'll improvise. (He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,Go on.
Aladdin,Jasmine,"And your beard...is so...twisted!  (She has her arms around him.  She pretends to twist with her finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN to come over.  He makes his move.  IAGO sees him.)"
Aladdin,Iago,Jaf--mmmmmm!
Aladdin,Jafar,And the street rat?
Aladdin,Jasmine,"What street rat? (They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.)"
Aladdin,Abu,Yuck!
Aladdin,Jafar,"That was--(he sees ALADDIN's reflection in her crown.) You!!  How many times do I have to kill you, boy? (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Get the lamp! (JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then zaps her into an hourglass.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Jasmine!
Aladdin,Iago,"Oh, nice shot, Jaf--"
Aladdin,Jafar,Don't toy with me!  (He's zapped into a toy monkey.
Aladdin,Aladdin,Abu!
Aladdin,Jafar,"Things are unraveling fast, now boy. (CARPET is zapped and unravels.  ALADDIN again rushes for the lamp.)  Get the point?  (His path is blocked by large swords sticking in the floor.  JAFAR grabs the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a sword out of the floor.) I'm just getting warmed up!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?"
Aladdin,Jafar,"A snake, am I?  Perhaps you'd like to see how snake-like I can be!  (He smiles broadly, and we see a snake's tongue come out from behind his teeth.  He then turns into a giant cobra, and the ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the snake encircling ALADDIN.  The snake JAFAR makes moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR.  Cut to GENIE cheerleaders wearing 'A' sweaters.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into that snake!"
Aladdin,Jafar,You stay out of thissss!
Aladdin,Genie,"Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't do it, GREAT! (ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path. ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Aladdin! (ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake's back and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to free the princess.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Hang on, Jasmine!"
Aladdin,Jafar,You little fool!  You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on earth!
Aladdin,Iago,"Squeeze him, Jafar--Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him out of the way)"
Aladdin,Jafar,"Without the genie, boy, you're nothing!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,The genie!  The genie!  The genie has more power than you'll ever have!
Aladdin,Jafar,What!!
Aladdin,Aladdin,"He gave you your power, he can take it away!"
Aladdin,Genie,"Al, what are you doing?  Why are you bringing me into this?"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Face it, Jafar--you're still just second best!"
Aladdin,Jafar,You're right!  His power does exceed my own!  But not for long!
Aladdin,Genie,The boy is crazy.  He's a little punch drunk.  One too many hits with the snake  (His hand turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)
Aladdin,Jafar,"Slave, I make my third wish!  I wish to be an all powerful genie!"
Aladdin,Genie,"All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al. brand lightning bolt. JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess pour out.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,Yes!  Yes!  The power! The absolute power!
Aladdin,Jasmine,What have you done?
Aladdin,Aladdin,Trust me!
Aladdin,Jafar,"The universe is mine to command, to control!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Not so fast, Jafar!  Aren't you forgetting something? You wanted to be a genie, you got it!  And everything that goes with it!"
Aladdin,Jafar,No!  No!
Aladdin,Iago,"I'm gettin' out of here!  Come on, you're the genie, I don't want--"
Aladdin,Aladdin,Phenomenal cosmic powers!  Itty bitty living space.
Aladdin,Genie,"Al, you little genius, you! (ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the new lamp.)"
Aladdin,Jafar,Get your blasted beak out of my face!
Aladdin,Iago,"Oh, shut up, you moron!"
Aladdin,Jafar,Don't tell me to shut up!
Aladdin,Genie,"Allow me.  (He takes the lamp and goes to the balcony.  He is now wearing a baseball cap.  He winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his palm flat and flicks it out into the desert with his finger.) Ten- thousand years in a cave of wonders ought to chill him out! (JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince."
Aladdin,Jasmine,I know why you did.
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Well, I guess...this... is goodbye?  (GENIE pokes his head around the corner shocked at what he is hearing.)"
Aladdin,Jasmine,"Oh, that stupid law.  This isn't fair--I love you."
Aladdin,Genie,"Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left.  Just say the word and you're a prince again."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"But Genie, what about your freedom?"
Aladdin,Genie,"Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.  This is love.    Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.  Believe me, I know.  I've looked."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Jasmine, I do love you, but I've got to stop pretending to be something I'm not."
Aladdin,Jasmine,"I understand. (They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIE.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Genie, I wish for your freedom."
Aladdin,Genie,One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.  I--what?
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Genie, you're free! (A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Heh, heh!  I'm free. I'm free.    Quick, quick, wish for something outrageous.  Say  ""I want the Nile.""   Wish for the Nile.  Try that!"
Aladdin,Aladdin,I wish for the Nile.
Aladdin,Genie,"No way!!  (Laughs hysterically.  He bounces around the balcony like a pinball.)  Oh does that feel good!  I'm free!  I'm free at last!  I'm hittin' the road.  I'm off to see the world!  I-- (He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking very sad.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Genie, I'm--I'm gonna miss you."
Aladdin,Genie,"Me too, Al.  No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me."
Aladdin,Sultan,That's right.  You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the problem.
Aladdin,Jasmine,Father?
Aladdin,Sultan,"Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?  From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy."
Aladdin,Aladdin,"Ha, ha.  Call me Al. (They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together. GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.)"
Aladdin,Genie,"Oh, all of ya. Come over here.  Big group hug! Mind if I kiss the monkey?    Ooh, hairball!  Well, I can't do any more damage around this popsicle stand.  I'm outta here!  Bye, bye, you two crazy lovebirds.  Hey, Rugman: ciao!  I'm history!   No, I'm mythology!  No, I don't care what I am--I'm free! (The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him.  They cut to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.)"
Aladdin,Aladdin,A whole new world
Aladdin,Jasmine,A whole new life
Aladdin,Both,"For you and me! MEN'S CHORUS:   A whole new world! (They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly the film is grabbed ""off the projector"", the GENIE lifts it up and looks at the audience.)"
Aladdin,Genie,Made ya look!
