Shang stands by the entrance.  Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite concerned.  Ling drums his fingers on his knees.  The medic comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang.  Shang looks astonished and goes into the tent.  Mulan is lying down.  She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.  She sits up allowing the blanket to fall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on her chest.  She sees Shang's surprised look and realizes her feminine form is noticeable]"

Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?     And what are you? A sheep?
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll finish.   I promise."

Mulan,Emperor,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"I know what this means to you, Captain Li.  Your father would have been very proud. [Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry the Emperor into the Palace.  Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating into the Palace to threaten would be rescue attempts]"
Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,"Boo.    Guard the door [they walk off down the stairs that lead to the balcony].    Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn.

Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,"Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword.  Shang swipes with his sword.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge.  Shang grabs onto a column and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu falls to the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls over forcing Shang to be on his back underneath him.  Shang uses his knee to hit Shan-Yu from behind as he uses his hand to hit him in the head.  Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his arm pulling it behind Shan-Yu's back.  Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the balcony from the stairs]"

Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,No! [Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face.  Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang and throws him to the ground.  Shang lies limp.  Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over the edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground.  Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight]
Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,"No!  [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the Emperor among the throng of people]  Yrraaaaahhhh! [Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang.  Shan-Yu pulls out his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them.  As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, he puts his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife.  Mulan slides away. Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by the shirt collar]"
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,No!  I did!
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,So what's the plan?

Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,I'm way ahead of you sister.  C'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower] [Cut to Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword wildly knocking down a support column with every swipe.  Mulan runs and ducks his every blow. Mulan climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach.  Shan-Yu slices the base of the column causing it to fall and break through the outer wall.  Mulan screams as the beam falls and comes to a stop.  Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning.  She looks off to her right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower] [Zoom in on the fireworks tower.  Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework lighters) on the edge of the tower]

Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,It looks like you're out of ideas. [Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through the fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that Shan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping off the fan with her sword movement]
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,"Not quite.    Ready, Mushu?"
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Your Majesty, I can explain. [The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside.  Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clear path to Mulan.  Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor.  Chi Fu with a sinister look waits to write down the words of the Emperor]"
Mulan,Emperor,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father's armor, ran away from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army, destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all. [Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan. Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit.  Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believing what she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on the ground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her.  Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]"

Mulan,Yao,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,Is she allowed to do that? [Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling.  Chien-Po comes up and lifts all three of them off the ground in a big bear hug.  Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground again.  Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him.  As Shang begins to speak Mulan starts to smile anticipating something good]
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,Um...  You...  You fight good.
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,:  Hmm.
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,"Khan, let's go home. [Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground level.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]"
Mulan,Emperor,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks back up the steps to his palace] [Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree.   A blossom falls and lands on his leg.  Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father.  Fa Zhou sees her approaching and starts to stand]"
