Mulan,Yao,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,I'll get that arrow pretty boy.  And I'll do it with my shirt on.
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"One moment, you seem to be missing something.  [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it high speaking to all the troops]  This represents discipline  [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao's arm with it]  and this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while Mulan looks concerned].  You need both to reach the arrow. [Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight.  Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take their turn and fall down.  Mulan rubs her behind as she walks away in front of Shang]"

Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,They completed their training.
Mulan,Chi-Fu,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain.  Once the general reads my report, your troops will never see battle."
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,Oh no you don't.  I've worked to hard to get Mulan into this war.  This guy's messing with my plan.
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,We're not finished.

Mushu talks to Cri-Kee]  I think it's time we took this war into our own hands . [Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent.  Chi Fu emerges with carrying a scrub brush and wrapped in a towel and with big showering slippers on his feet.  He whistles as he walks off.  Mushu and Cri-Kee enter his tent.  Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter.  He finishes and Mushu takes the paper]"
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"Okay, okay, let me see what you've got.  From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot if you'd come and back us up.    That's great except you forgot, ""and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't mind bringing up some.""  Hellooooo, this is the army!  Make it sound more urgent, please!  You know what I'm talkin' about?  [Cri-Kee starts writing the note again]  That's better, much better.   Okay, Let's go."

Mulan,Chi-Fu,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Insubordinate ruffians.    You men owe me a new pair of slippers.  And I do not squeal like a girl.   Aaaaaahhhhhh! Mushu [sitting on top of the panda bear behind a dummy of a soldier using sticks to gesticulate with the dummy's arms to push the note towards Chi Fu.  Cri-Kee works the mouth]:  Urgent news from the general!    What's the matter, you've never seen a 'black and white' before?"
Mulan,Chi-Fu,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,Who are you?
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"Excuse me!  I think the question is: who are you?  We're in a war man!  There's no time for stupid questions.  I should have your hat for that,  snatch it right off of your head [swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat.  Mushu turns the upper half of the dummy around after the panda passes Chi Fu.  Chi Fu begins reading the message].  But I'm feeling gracious today, so carry on before I report you."
Mulan,Chi-Fu,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,Captain.  Urgent news from the General.  We're needed at the front.
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"Pack your bags Cri-Kee, we're movin' out."
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,Huh?
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,Search for survivors. [Cut to Mulan walking around the burned-out village.  She finds a the doll that Shan-Yu was holding and looks up sorrowfully.  Shang comes to her side]
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,I don't understand.  My father should have been here.
Mulan,Chi-Fu,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Captain! [Chi Fu points down to the valley where the remains of General Li's army can be seen.  Flags poking up out of the snow, armor lying face down, broken cannon carts.  Ling, Yao, Mulan, and a soldier have the look of horror on their faces as they look into the valley.  Chien-Po walks up from the valley carrying a helmet]"
Mulan,Chien-Po,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,...the General. [Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill.  He draws his sword and stabs it into the snow upright.  He kneels down and places the helmet on top of the sword.  Mulan approaches him from behind]
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,"I'm sorry. [Shang gets up, turns around and puts his hand on Mulan's shoulder and he walks by.  Shang walks to the center of the troops. He grabs his horse by the saddle, takes one quick look of grief then mounts his horse]"
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"The Huns are moving quickly.  We'll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass.  We're the only hope for the Emperor now.  Move out! [Mulan looks at the sword, takes out the doll she found and places the doll at the base of the sword.  She turns around and joins the rest of the troops marching on] [Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons.  A cannon blast shoots out of the cart and explodes in the air.  The troops look surprised.  Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face.  Mushu points at Cri-Kee.  Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind]"
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,What happened?!

Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,You just gave away our position.  Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the arrow]   Get out of range!! [The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them.  Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up.  Fire arrows start hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.  The cart begins to blaze with fire]
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Save the cannons! [The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him from bolting.  Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.  The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan free from the cart.  She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire.  The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet and sword which land near her.  Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan."
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"Oh sure, save the horse. [Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position.  Cri-Kee and Khan follow.  Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and other recruits set up cannons against rocks.  They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them]"
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,Fire!
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Fire! [Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  No more arrows can be seen coming from the mountain position]"
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Hold the last cannon.    Prepare to fight.  If we die, we die with honor. [Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's position.  His falcon flies off his shoulder on Shan-Yu's war cry  The Hun army follows]"
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu. [The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords.  Mulan looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snow embankment hanging to the side of a cliff.  She rushes forward]"
Mulan,Yao,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,Hey.
Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Ping, come back.  Ping! [Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon.  Mushu looks over her at the oncoming horde with worry in his eyes]"

Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"All right, you might want to light that right about now.  Quickly!  Quickly!"
Mulan,Yao,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"C'mon, we've gotta help. [Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain.  She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him causing him to light the fuse.  Mushu lands on the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu]"
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,You missed him!  How could you miss?  He was three feet in front of you! [The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche.  Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face and Shan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by the snow]
Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,"Yrrrrrrraah. [Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side.  Mulan falls back grabbing her right side.  Shan-Yu's horse stumbles. Mulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche.  Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his horse.  Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him.   Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him, turning him around and helping him run away from the avalanche] Yao, Chien-Po and Ling :  Yeeahhhhhh!  [they stop.  noticing the oncoming avalanche they  turn around and run back to where they came from]  Waaaaaaaaaa! [Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up Shan-Yu and his horse.  Khan arrives at Mulan's position just ahead of the avalanche.  Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang.  She grabs his hand, then the avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing the oncoming avalanche of snow] [Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock.  They see the snow approaching close and run to larger shelter where the rest of Shang's army is positioned just as the avalance reaches their posision]"
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,Mulan!  Mulan!   Mulan?
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"Nope.  Mulan!    Man, you are one lucky bug. [Cut to Mulan riding Khan above the snow into the teeth of the avalanche.  Khan and Mulan are swept under by the snow and reemerge quickly.  She looks back and sees Shang passed out riding the wave of snow]"
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,"Shang, Shang!  [Mulan turns around and rides to Shang's position.  She picks him up and places him on Khan.  She turns Khan around again to be riding upstream]"

Mulan,Yao,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands.  He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers grab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff]"
Mulan,Yao,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Pull [Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers.  He lifts them all up and pulls backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu and Cri-Kee to safety]"

Shang stands by the entrance.  Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite concerned.  Ling drums his fingers on his knees.  The medic comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang.  Shang looks astonished and goes into the tent.  Mulan is lying down.  She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.  She sits up allowing the blanket to fall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on her chest.  She sees Shang's surprised look and realizes her feminine form is noticeable]"

Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"Well that's because this just needs a little spit, that's all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping the spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.

[Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry the Emperor into the Palace.

She whistles loudly catching the soldiers' attention]  Hey guys, I've got an idea. We must be swift as the coursing river With all the force of a great typhoon With all the strength of a raging fire Mysterious as the dark side of the moon [Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue and follow Mulan.  Shang looks astonished.  Around the corner Yao, Ling and Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and dress as women.  Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes and prepare to shimmy up the columns.  Shang arrives and taps Mulan on the shoulder.  He takes off his cape and wraps it around the column to signify that he's coming along.  They shimmy up the poles together]"
Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,"Boo.    Guard the door [they walk off down the stairs that lead to the balcony].    Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn.

Mulan,Ling,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,Oh he's so cute. [Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back.  Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2.  A bitten apple falls out from beneath Ling's dress.  He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss of figure]

Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"Now that's what I call Mongolian Barbeque.  [Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter.  The stunned falcon doesn't do anything] [Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling.  Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull out the fruit they were using to simulate a woman's chest.  Chien-Po takes his watermelons and smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2.  He then smashes their two heads together and they fall to the ground.  Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the stomach causing Hun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground.  Ling uses his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back.  Hun Strong Guy lunges his fist at Yao and misses, he misses with the other.  Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks away Hun Archer Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning her back to Hun Archer.  She follows with a left elbow to the stomach followed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground.  She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull his head back]"

Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge.  Shang grabs onto a column and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu falls to the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls over forcing Shang to be on his back underneath him.  Shang uses his knee to hit Shan-Yu from behind as he uses his hand to hit him in the head.  Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his arm pulling it behind Shan-Yu's back.  Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the balcony from the stairs]"
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,"Chien-Po, get the Emperor."
Mulan,Chien-Po,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Sorry, your Majesty. [Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column in the balcony.  Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground.  Shan Yu watches the Emperor leave]"
Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,No! [Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face.  Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang and throws him to the ground.  Shang lies limp.  Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over the edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground.  Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight]
Mulan,Yao,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Come on! [Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look.  Shan-Yu begins to approach Mulan and the rope. Mulan looks at the approaching Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking quickly, Mulan grabs Shan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope.  Shan-Yu reaches the edge and grabs for the falling rope unsuccessfully as Mulan leaves the sword embedded in the column and runs to Shang's position.  The crowd cheers]"

[Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang.  Shan-Yu pulls out his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them.  As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, he puts his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife.  Mulan slides away. Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by the shirt collar]"

Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,No!  I did!
Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,The soldier from the mountains. [Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs and through the doors to the balcony.  She closes the door with the latch falling in place right behind her.  She leans against the doors.  Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his fist. Mulan runs away from the doors down the corridor.  Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a horse catches up with Mulan]
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,So what's the plan?
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,Ummmm.

[Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower] [Cut to Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword wildly knocking down a support column with every swipe.  Mulan runs and ducks his every blow. Mulan climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach.  Shan-Yu slices the base of the column causing it to fall and break through the outer wall.  Mulan screams as the beam falls and comes to a stop.  Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning.  She looks off to her right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower] [Zoom in on the fireworks tower.  Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework lighters) on the edge of the tower]

Mulan,Shan-Yu,Male,Hun,Hun,Antagonist,False,False,It looks like you're out of ideas. [Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through the fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that Shan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping off the fan with her sword movement]
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,"Not quite.    Ready, Mushu?"
Mulan,Mushu,Male,Mythical Creature,Chinese,Supporting,False,False,"I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework]  Light me!  [Cri-Kee lights the fuse] [Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and stabs it into Shan-Yu's cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan lies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to run, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly propelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the rocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the roof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]"
Mulan,Mulan,Female,Chinese,Chinese,Protagonist,True,True,"Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof. [The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to fly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the ground.  Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by]"

Mulan,Shang,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"Your Majesty, I can explain. [The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside.  Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clear path to Mulan.  Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor.  Chi Fu with a sinister look waits to write down the words of the Emperor]"
Mulan,Emperor,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,"I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father's armor, ran away from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army, destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all. [Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan. Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit.  Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believing what she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on the ground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her.  Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]"

Mulan,Yao,Male,Chinese,Chinese,Supporting,True,True,Is she allowed to do that? [Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling.  Chien-Po comes up and lifts all three of them off the ground in a big bear hug.  Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground again.  Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him.  As Shang begins to speak Mulan starts to smile anticipating something good]
