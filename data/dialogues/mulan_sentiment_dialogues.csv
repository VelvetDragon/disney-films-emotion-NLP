Mulan looks down to see her reflection in the puddle caused by the rain. She watches her parents in the bedroom.  Fa Li turns away from Fa Zhou and walks out of site.  Fa Zhou blows out the light.  Mulan gets up and walks to the Fa Family Temple.  Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she lights incense and places it in the hanging encense holder.  She bows and prays to her ancestors. Getting up, Mulan hurries down the steps.  Cri-Kee sees her and hops down from above and follows her.  Mulan goes to her parent's bedroom and takes the conscription notice replacing it with the hair comb her mother gave to her.  She pauses to give her parents a loving, sorrowful look and hurries out.  Cut to Mulan in the armory.  She opens the cabinet with the armor. Using her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and ties it up above her head.  She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the front.  She takes the sword and places it in the scabbard to her left.  Cut to Mulan in the stable doorway.  Khan rears back in fright at the sight of Mulan.  Mulan goes forward and comforts Khan letting him know her identity.  Mulan walks Khan out of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground as she passes by.  Mulan takes one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan through the gate and off to camp.] [Cut to the face of a statue in the Fa Family Temple.  The eyes glow.
