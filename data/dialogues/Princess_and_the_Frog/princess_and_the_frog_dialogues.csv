The Princess and the Frog,Eudora,"Just in that moment, the ugly little frog looked up with his sad, round eyes and pleaded: ""Oh, please, dear princess, Only a kiss from you can break this terrible spell, that was inflicted on me by a wicked witch."""
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,There comes my favorite part.
The Princess and the Frog,Eudora,"And the beautiful princess was so moved by his desperate plea, that she stooped down, picked up the slippery creature, leaned forward, raised him to her lips, and kissed that little frog. Than the frog was transformed into a handsome prince. They were married and lived happily ever after. The end."
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"Yay! Read it again, read it again!"
The Princess and the Frog,Eudora,"Sorry Charlotte, it’s time for us to be headin’ home. Say good night, Tiana."
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"There is no way, in this whole wide world I would ever, ever, ever, I mean never kiss a frog. Yuck!"
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"Is that so?  Well, here's your prince charming, Tia. Come on, kiss him."
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,No!
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,Kiss him!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Stop it!
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him!"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"I won’t, I won’t, I won’t!"
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"I would do it. I would kiss a frog. I would kiss a hundred frogs, if I could marry a prince and be a princess."
The Princess and the Frog,Eurora,"You girls, stop tormentin’ that poor little kitty!  Poor little thing..."
The Princess and the Frog,Eli Big Daddy La Bouff,Evenin’ Eudora!
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"Daddy, Daddy, look at my new dress! Isn’t it pretty?"
The Princess and the Frog,Big Daddy,"Hah, hah, look at you. Why, I’d expect nothin’ less from the finest seamstress in New Orleans."
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"Uuh, I want that there."
The Princess and the Frog,Big Daddy,"Oh, no sugar come on."
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"I want that one. Please, please, please, please!"
The Princess and the Frog,Big Daddy,Eudora. You suppose you can web something up like that?

The Princess and the Frog,Travis,"But Miss Charlotte, you said ""later"" 2 hours ago!"
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"Travis, when a woman says ""later"", she really means ""not ever""! Now, run along. There are plenty of young fillies dyin' for you to waltz them into a stupor.  GIMME THEM NAPKINS, QUICK!"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,What on Earth for?
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"I swear I am sweatin' like a sinner in church! Oh, Tia, is gettin’ to be so late. - There’s still a few stragglers. This is a failure. Tia, my prince is never comin’. - Now, Lottie… - I never get anything I wish for! Lottie, wait! - Just calm down and take a deep… - Maybe I just got to wish harder.

Well…back into the fray! Wish me luck. Oh, Naveen"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Almost… Almost there People would come here from everywhere I was almost…there...
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,I can not believe I’m doing this. Please… Please… Please!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"Very funny. So, what now? I reckon you want a kiss?"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Kissing would be nice, yes?  I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I did not mean to scare you, I… Wait, no , no… Wait, wait, wait, hold on. You know, you have a very strong arm, princess. Ok, please! Put the monkey down."

The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"Prince? But I didn’t wish for any… Hold on, if you’re the prince, then… then who was that waltzing with Lottie on the dance floor?"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"All I know, is one minute I am a prince, charming and handsome, cutting-a-rug, and the next thing I know, …I am tripping over these. Wait, wait, wait… Wait! I know this story! Di Frogie Prutto!"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,The Frog Prince?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Yes, yes, yes… My mother had the servants read this to me every night. Yes, yes… this is exactly the answer! You must kiss me!"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Excuse me?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"You will enjoy it, I guarantee. All women enjoy the kiss… of Prince Naveen. Come, we pucker. That’s new."
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"Look, I’m sorry. I’d really like to help you, but I just… Do not kiss frogs."
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Wait a second! But…On the balcony, you ask me…"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,I didn’t expect you to answer!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Oh, but you must kiss me. Look, besides being unbelievably handsome, I also happened to come from a fabulously wealthy family. Surely, I can offer you some type of reward or a wish I could grant perhaps… Yes?"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Just… One kiss?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,Just one. Unless you beg for more.
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"Ok Tiana, you can do this… Just a little kiss, just a little kiss. Ok! You don’t look there much different. But how did you get way up there? And how did I get way down here, in all this…  AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Easy princess, do not panic!"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,What did you do to me? I…I’m green and I’m…and I’m slimy!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"No, no, no … This is not slime."
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,What?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,You’re secreting mucus.
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,You...You....
The Princess and the Frog,Big Daddy,Hey Stella! Get them frogs!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,Run!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"I can’t run, I’m a frog!"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Then hop! Calm boy, calm you monster dog! En garde!"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,Look out! Get out of the way.
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Where are we going?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,Excuse me!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,I can’t see a thing.
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Me neither, can I?"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"Wait, Stella…"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,Going up!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"Stella, it’s me, Tiana!"
The Princess and the Frog,Dog,Tiana?
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Stella just talked to me! The dog just spoke to me!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"You know, if you are going to let every little thing bother you… It’s going to be very long night!"
The Princess and the Frog,Lawrence,"Oh, dear.  Oh! You're so quiet. Dr. Facilier: You let him go?!"
The Princess and the Frog,Lawrence,"The poor devil's gasping, so I'd loosened the lid, ever so slightly...  How did I ever get tangled up this voodoo madness? I can't get through with this!  You wear this-this ghastly thing! Dr. Facilier:  CAREFUL WITH THAT!!! ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THIS, I'M GONNA BE...!  Fun fact about voodoo, Larry...  ...can't conjure a thing for myself. Besides, you and I both know the real power in this world ain't magic. It's money! Buckets of it."
The Princess and the Frog,Lawrence,That's true. Dr. Facilier: Aren't you tired of living on the margins? While all those fat cats in their fancy cars don't give you so much as a sideways glance?
The Princess and the Frog,Lawrence,"Yes... I am. Dr. Facilier: All you gotta do is marry Big Daddy's little princess...  And we'll be splittin' that juicy Le Buoff fortune right down the middle... 60-40, like I said."
The Princess and the Frog,Lawrence,Hmm... yeah. But uh... what about Naveen? Dr. Facilier: Your little SLIP-UP... will be a minor bump in the road. So long as we got the prince's blood in this.
The Princess and the Frog,Lawrence,Yes...
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Voodoo? You mean to tell me this all happened because you were messing with the Shadow Man?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,He was very charismatic!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,It serves me right for wishing on stars. The only way to get what you want in this world is through hard work.
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,Hard work? Why… why would a princess need to work hard?
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"Huh? Oh, I’m not a princess. I’m a waitress."
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"A waitress? Well, no wonder the kiss did not work! You lied to me!"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,I…I never said I was a princess.
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,You never said you were a w… a waitress! You were wearing a crown.
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"It was a costume party, you spoiled little rich boy."
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Oh, oh yes, oh ye? Well, the egg is on your face, alright, because I do not have any riches!"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,What?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,I am completely broke.  Uh oh!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,You said … you were fabulously wealthy!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"No, no, no. My parents are fabulously wealthy. But they cut me off for being a… Leech! Leech!"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"You’re broke, and you had the gall to call me a liar?"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,It was not a lie! I fully inte…  Aaah! I fully intend to be rich again! Once I marry Miss Charlotte La Bouff’ and she will help me!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,You a prince?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,Obviously!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"She’ll help you!  All right then. once you two are married, you are gonna keep your promise and get me my restaurant, right?"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Whoa, oh, not so fast. I made that promise to a beautiful princess, not a cranky wai… Why are those logs moving?"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Those aren’t logs...
The Princess and the Frog,Alligator,"I got glimpse on a big one. C’mon, come here! Come here you tasty one mussel! Where did they go?"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,Lower the vine.
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Find your own tree. There he is. I’ve seen him! I’ve seen him!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Okay, help me get out of this swamp and once I married Charlotte, I shall get you your restaurant. You gonna taste so good you wasted invaluable rat!"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Quick, quick, pull me up!"
The Princess and the Frog,Alligator,You can hop but you can’t hide.
The Princess and the Frog,Alligator,We got all night!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Well, waitress, looks like we going to be here for a while. So we may as well get … comfortable."
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Take your slimes away from me.
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,I’ve told you … It is not slime! It is mucus!
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty. Gators are gone. We got to get back to New Orleans and undo this mess you got us into."
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,I was not the one parading around with your phony baloney tiara. Music de paddle bil.
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Could use a little help!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,I will play a little louder.
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,How about a little less piggin’ and a … I know that tune! Dippermouth Blues.
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Play it, brother!"
The Princess and the Frog,Louis,Where you’ve been all my life?!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,Where did you learn to play like that?
The Princess and the Frog,Louis,"Well, the Bajou’s is the best jazz school in the world. All the greats play the riverboats. Oh, Louis give anything to be up there jammin’ with the big boys."
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,So why don’t you?
The Princess and the Frog,Louis,"Oh, I tried once.  It didn’t end well."
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"It is been a real pleasure meetin’ you, Louis. And thank you for coming and for not eatin’ us. We best be on our way."
The Princess and the Frog,Louis,Where are you goin’?
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,To find somebody to break the spell.
The Princess and the Frog,Louis,What spell?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Brace yourself, my skilly friend, We are not frogs … We are humans."
The Princess and the Frog,Louis,What?  You are serious?
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"I am Naveen, Prince of Maldonia. And she is Tiana, the waitress. Do not kiss her."
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,Now just a second. This goon here got himself turned into a frog by a voodoo man and now …
The Princess and the Frog,Louis,Voodoo? Like the kind Mama Odie do.
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Mama, hoodie?"
The Princess and the Frog,Louis,Mama Odie. She is the voodoo queen of the Bajou. She got magic and spells of kind a voodoo .
The Princess and the Frog,Both,Could you take us to her?
The Princess and the Frog,Louis,"To the deepest, darkest part of a Bayou?? Facing raser sharks, prick ambushers, and trappers, and hunters with guns? No."
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Watch and learn. Louis, that’s too bad we can not help you with your dream. If only you were smaller… less toothy. You can play jazz to adoring crowd without scaring them. Anyway, enjoy your loneliness, my friend! Abenaza."
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,"Cute, but it’s not gonna…"
The Princess and the Frog,Lauis,"Hey guys, I just had me a crazy idea. What about if I ask Mama Odie to turn me human?"
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Louis, you are a genius."
The Princess and the Frog,Lauis,"Hallelujah! If I were a human being I’d head straight for New Orleans and I’d blow this horn so hot and strong like no one they’d ever seen Louis Armstrong, Mister Sydney Bechet All the boys gonna step aside when they hear this old Alligator play Listen! When I’m human as I hope to be I’m gonna blow this horn till the cows come home and everyone’s gonna bow down to me! Thank you! Thank you! Aw, thank you! I love you too baby! When I’m myself again I want just the life I had a great big party every night that doesn’t sound too bad a redhead on my left arm a brunette on my right a blonde or two to hold a candle that seem just about right Eh, Louis? Life is short when you’re done, you’re done we’re on this Earth to have some fun - and that’s the way things are Say it, brother! When I’m human, and I’m gonna be I’m gonna tear it up like I did before that’s a royal guarantee"
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,You are getting married!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,All right. I just have to leave a string of broken hearts behind me. Your modesty becomes you and your sense of responsibility I worked hard for everything I got and that’s the way it’s supposed to be When I’m a human being at least I’ll act like one if you do your best each and every day good things are sure to come your way What you give is what you get! My daddy said that and now I’ll never forget and I amend it to you When we’re human and we’re gonna be I’m gonna blow my horn! I’m gonna live the high life! I’m gonna do my best to take my place in the sun When we’re human!
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"Oh, Prince Naveen, dear. I am positively mortified you had to endure that frog fiasco last night."
The Princess and the Frog,Lawrence,"Well, when you’re next in line for the throne, you’re poised like a panther, ready to expect the unexpected."
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,Y-your ear?
The Princess and the Frog,Lawrence,"What? Oh, there’s pesky mosquitoes… everywhere. Get in here! Please, Miss Charlotte, I can no longer ignore the throbbing of my… Heart. Even though our time together’s been brief, it’s been heavenly."
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"Land sakes Prince Naveen, You got me blushin’ ‘til I…"
The Princess and the Frog,Lawrence,Would you do me the honor of becoming Princess of Maldonia?

Dr. Facilier: Think of all those maecenas who doubted you. You ain’t never gonna get enough for the dang payment. Woman of your background, you better off will y’all. Dr. Facilier: And don’t forget your poor Daddy. Now, that was one hard working man. See you tomorrow, James! Dr. Facilier: Double, sometimes triple shifts. Never let know how bone tired, beat darlin’ really was. Daddy! Hey, baby cakes. Dr. Facilier: Shame on that hard work, didn’t amount much more than a busted up, old gumbo pot and a dream that never get off the back porch. But you? You can give your poor Daddy everything he ever wanted. Come on, Tiana. You’re almost there."

The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"Once you became my wife, that made you..."
The Princess and the Frog,Tiana,A princess. You just kissed yourself a princess!
The Princess and the Frog,Naveen,"And I’m about to do it again. ! In the South Land there’s A city Way down on the river Where the women are very pretty And all the men deliver They got music It’s always playin’ Start in the day time, go all through the night When you hear that music playin’ Hear what I’m saying and make it feel alright"
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,Who would’ve thought the prince would've had a younger brother. How old did you say you were? I’m six and a half.
The Princess and the Frog,Charlotte,"Well, I've waited this long. Grab somebody, come on down Bring your paintbrush, we’re painting the town There’s some sweetness going around Dreams do come true in New Orleans."
