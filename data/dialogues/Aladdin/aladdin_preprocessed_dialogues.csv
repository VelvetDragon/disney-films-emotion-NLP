To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels, and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a neon ""APPLAUSE"" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that is is empty.)","Master, I do not think you quite realize what you have got here! So why do not you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate the possibilities.
